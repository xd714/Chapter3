# if I want to research genetic variance after long term body weight selection, which steps should I try? to prove that the variance still there or not there anymore?  give me corresponding literatures to read so that I understand why, what , and how in these steps

To investigate genetic variance persistence in long-term selected populations like the DU6 mouse line, follow this evidence-based approach supported by key literature:

## 1. **Quantitative Genetic Analysis**

**Why**: Track allele frequency changes and inbreeding effects
**What**:

- Calculate pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients vs genomic ROH (Runs of Homozygosity)
- Compare BLUP-EBV trends with genomic predictions (GBLUP)

**Literature Support**:

- *Temporal and genomic analysis of additive genetic variance* demonstrates variance partitioning into genic and LD components using marker-based models[^1][^2]
- *Genetic Variance Estimation in Broiler Programmes* provides protocols for monitoring σ²ₐ via sliding window REML analyses[^3]


## 2. **Bottleneck Detection**

**Why**: Identify diversity loss during facility transfer
**What**:

- Calculate effective population size (Nₑ) pre/post-transfer:
$Nₑ = \frac{1}{2\Delta F}$
- Perform allele frequency spectrum analysis

**Literature Support**:

- Virginia body weight lines study shows how selection reshapes haplotype diversity through bottlenecks[^4]
- Broiler breeding analysis reveals how novel mutations compensate variance loss[^3]


## 3. **Genomic Selection Impact**

**Why**: Assess OCS efficacy in maintaining diversity
**What**:

- Compare founder genome equivalents pre/post-OCS
- Analyze mate allocation patterns via Gini index

**Literature Support**:

- Layer chicken simulation demonstrates OCS balances gain/variance better than truncation selection[^5][^6]
- *Practical Considerations...* details variance retention strategies in GS programs[^7]


## 4. **Variance Source Identification**

**Why**: Distinguish standing variation vs new mutations
**What**:

- Conduct GWAS on BM42 using deregressed BLUP-EBVs
- Screen whole-genome sequences for de novo mutations

**Literature Support**:

- Virginia lines resequencing identifies persistent QTLs despite high homozygosity[^4]
- Heredity framework enables tracking chromosome-specific variance contributions[^1][^2]


## 5. **Fertility-Inbreeding Correlation**

**Why**: Test fitness consequences of diversity loss
**What**:

- Model:
$\text{Fertility} \sim F_{ped} + F_{ROH} + \text{BM42 EBV}$

**Literature Support**:

- Broiler study links maintained variance to reproductive trait stability[^3]


## Critical Literature Matrix

| Research Aspect | Key Paper | Methodology Contribution |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Variance Partitioning | [^1][^2] Heredity | Genic vs LD variance decomposition |
| Long-term GS Effects | [^5][^6] Front. Genet | OCS vs truncation selection simulations |
| Mutation Load Analysis | [^3] Poultry Variance Monitoring | Novel mutation impact quantification |
| Selection Signature Detection | [^4] Virginia Lines | Pooled resequencing in selected populations |

These studies provide both theoretical frameworks (e.g., variance partitioning models[^1][^2]) and practical protocols (e.g., sliding window REML[^3]) essential for analyzing the DU6 line. Focus on [^1][^2] for genomic variance tracking methods and [^5][^6] for OCS optimization strategies in bottlenecked populations.
