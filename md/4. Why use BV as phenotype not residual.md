You've raised an excellent point about potential double counting in GWAS design. Let me break down why breeding values are still commonly used despite this concern, and when residuals might be preferred.

**Why breeding values are used as phenotypes in GWAS:**

The key is that breeding values and genomic relationships capture different types of genetic information. Breeding values from pedigree-based models (like BLUP) estimate genetic merit based on family relationships and population structure. When you then model these breeding values genomically in GWAS, you're looking for specific genomic regions that explain variation beyond what's captured by the overall genomic relationship matrix (GRM).

The genomic relationship matrix in GWAS captures genome-wide similarity, while individual SNP effects capture local genomic effects. These aren't exactly the same - the GRM provides a background correction for population structure and cryptic relatedness, while SNP tests identify specific functional variants.

**When this might be problematic:**

You're right that there can be some redundancy, especially when:

- The same individuals used to estimate breeding values are used in GWAS
- Genomic information was already incorporated in breeding value estimation
- High levels of family structure exist in the population

**Why residuals can be better:**

Using residuals as phenotypes makes sense when you want to identify genetic effects not already captured by known relationships and environmental factors. Residuals represent the "unexplained" variation that could be due to:

- Novel genetic variants not tagged by pedigree relationships
- Rare variants with large effects
- Epistatic interactions

**Best practice depends on your goal:**

- Use breeding values when you want to find all genomic regions associated with the trait, accepting some redundancy with population structure
- Use residuals when you specifically want to find "new" genetic effects not explained by existing models

Many modern approaches use genomic breeding values (GBLUP residuals) or single-step methods that more elegantly combine pedigree, genomic, and phenotypic information to avoid this double-counting issue.
