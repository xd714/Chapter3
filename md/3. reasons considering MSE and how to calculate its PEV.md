# I only have 1 family, why do I have to consider Mendelian sampling variance of body weight 42 under long term selection? how PEV of Mendelian sampling variance calculated? show me literatures supported these methods

Even if you have only one family, considering Mendelian sampling variance (MSV) is crucial in long-term selection studies for several reasons:

## Why Consider Mendelian Sampling Variance with One Family?

- **Within-family Genetic Variance:** MSV represents the genetic variation among siblings due to the random segregation of parental alleles. Even in a single family, this variance determines the potential for selection among the offspring and is a key component of the total genetic variance available for future selection[^5][^7].
- **Long-term Selection Response:** Sustained genetic gain depends on the presence of MSV, especially when between-family variance is exhausted by selection or drift. The ability to generate top-performing individuals relies on Mendelian sampling, not just on differences between families[^5][^7].
- **Selection Limits and Genetic Progress:** As shown by Woolliams et al. (1999) and others, the long-term response to selection is maintained by MSV. Without it, selection would quickly reach a plateau, even in a single family scenario[^5][^7].


## How is the PEV of Mendelian Sampling Variance Calculated?

- **PEV (Prediction Error Variance) of MSV:**
The PEV of Mendelian sampling for an individual can be calculated as the difference between the PEV of the individual's breeding value and the average PEV of its parents' breeding values. Mathematically, for individual \$ i \$,

$$
\text{PEV}_{MS,i} = \text{PEV}_{i} - 0.5(\text{PEV}_{\text{sire}} + \text{PEV}_{\text{dam}})
$$

This quantifies the uncertainty in the Mendelian sampling term, which is the deviation of the individual's genetic merit from its parent average[^7].
- **Genomic Approaches:**
With SNP or phased genotype data, MSV can also be estimated by simulating or analytically calculating the variance among all possible gametes produced by the parents, considering recombination and marker effects[^3][^4][^6].
    - Niehoff et al. (2024) provide exact formulae for within-family genetic variance using phased genotypes and marker effects, allowing direct calculation of MSV for complex families, including single-family scenarios[^4][^6].
    - Cole \& VanRaden (2011) describe using haplotype information to estimate MS effects and the associated variances, which is especially relevant for genomic selection programs[^7].


## Key Literature Supporting These Methods

- **Woolliams et al. (1999); Wray \& Thompson (1990):** Classic works showing the central role of MSV in sustaining genetic gain and its calculation in selection programs[^5][^7].
- **Niehoff et al. (2024, G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics):** Presents analytical methods for predicting additive genetic variance in descendants based on MSV, with formulae applicable to any family structure, including a single family[^4][^6].
- **Cole \& VanRaden (2011):** Discusses estimation of MS effects and variances using haplotypes and genomic data, emphasizing their importance even when only one family is present[^7].
- **Bijma et al. (2018); Segelke et al. (2014):** Show that selection on parents with greater MSV can increase the probability of breeding top-ranking individuals, highlighting the practical value of MSV in breeding decisions[^5].


## Summary Table

| Reason to Consider MSV | Method for Calculating PEV of MSV | Key References |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Maintains within-family selection potential | PEV of individual minus average PEV of parents | [^7] |
| Sustains long-term genetic gain | Simulation/analytical calculation using phased genotypes | [^3][^4][^6] |
| Informs optimal selection strategies | Haplotype-based estimation, genomic prediction | [^5][^7] |

**In conclusion:**
Mendelian sampling variance is essential to quantify, even with a single family, because it underpins the genetic variability available for selection and long-term progress. The PEV of MSV can be calculated using pedigree or genomic information, and several studies provide both the theoretical justification and practical methods for doing so[^3][^4][^5][^6][^7].
