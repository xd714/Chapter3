# Chapter 21: High-Dimensional Statistics - Mathematical Explanations

## Overview
High-dimensional statistics deals with data where the number of variables p is large relative to the sample size n, or even p >> n. This chapter covers the challenges, methodologies, and theoretical foundations for statistical inference in high-dimensional settings.

## 21.1 Introduction to High-Dimensional Statistics

### The High-Dimensional Paradigm
**Traditional statistics:** n >> p (many observations, few variables)
**High-dimensional statistics:** p ≥ n or p >> n

**Examples:**
- **Genomics:** Gene expression (p ≈ 20,000 genes, n ≈ 100 samples)
- **Neuroimaging:** fMRI voxels (p ≈ 100,000 voxels, n ≈ 50 subjects)
- **Text analysis:** Word frequencies (p ≈ 10,000 words, n ≈ 1,000 documents)
- **Finance:** Asset returns (p ≈ 1,000 assets, n ≈ 250 trading days)

### Challenges in High Dimensions

**Curse of dimensionality:**
- Volume concentration
- Distance concentration  
- Computational complexity

**Statistical challenges:**
- Classical asymptotic theory breaks down
- Overfitting becomes severe
- Multiple testing issues
- Sparsity assumptions often needed

**Computational challenges:**
- Matrix operations become expensive O(p³)
- Storage requirements O(p²)
- Optimization becomes harder

## 21.2 Concentration of Measure

### Phenomenon
In high dimensions, random variables concentrate around their means.

### Gaussian Concentration
For X ~ N(0, Iₚ):
```
P(||X||₂² - p| ≥ t) ≤ 2exp(-t²/(8p))
```

**Implication:** ||X||₂² ≈ √p with high probability.

### Sub-Gaussian Concentration
Random variable X is **sub-Gaussian with parameter σ²** if:
```
E[exp(λ(X - E[X]))] ≤ exp(σ²λ²/2)
```

**Hoeffding's inequality for sub-Gaussian:**
```
P(|Sₙ - E[Sₙ]| ≥ t) ≤ 2exp(-t²/(2nσ²))
```

### Applications
- Sample covariance matrices concentrate around population covariance
- Empirical risk concentrates around expected risk
- Random matrix eigenvalues have predictable behavior

## 21.3 Random Matrix Theory

### Wishart Matrices
For X with rows Xᵢ ~ N(0, Σ):
```
W = (1/n)XᵀX
```

**Classical regime (p fixed, n → ∞):** W → Σ

**High-dimensional regime (p/n → γ ∈ (0, ∞)):** Marchenko-Pastur law

### Marchenko-Pastur Distribution
**Setting:** p/n → γ, Σ = Iₚ

**Limiting spectral distribution:**
```
ρ(x) = (1/2πγx)√(b-x)(x-a)I[a,b](x)
```

where a = (1-√γ)², b = (1+√γ)²

**Key insight:** Eigenvalues spread out even when population eigenvalues are equal.

### Spike Models
**Population:** Σ has few large eigenvalues (spikes) plus noise

**Sample eigenvalues:**
- Large population eigenvalues: Detectable if above √γ threshold  
- Small population eigenvalues: Form continuous spectrum

### Applications
- **PCA in high dimensions:** Which components are signal vs noise?
- **Covariance estimation:** Shrinkage toward structured estimators
- **Portfolio optimization:** Eigenvalue regularization

## 21.4 Sparsity and Variable Selection

### Sparsity Assumption
Many coefficients are exactly zero: ||β||₀ = |{j : βⱼ ≠ 0}| = s << p

**Motivation:**
- Interpretability
- Computational efficiency
- Statistical efficiency
- Domain knowledge

### Best Subset Selection
**Optimization problem:**
```
min_β ||Y - Xβ||₂² subject to ||β||₀ ≤ s
```

**Computational complexity:** NP-hard, requires O(p^s) evaluations

### Convex Relaxations

**LASSO (L1 penalty):**
```
min_β (1/2)||Y - Xβ||₂² + λ||β||₁
```

**Key insight:** L1 penalty encourages sparsity through convex optimization.

**Solution path:** Piecewise linear as function of λ

### Elastic Net
```
min_β (1/2)||Y - Xβ||₂² + λ₁||β||₁ + λ₂||β||₂²
```

**Combines:** Variable selection (L1) + grouping effect (L2)

### Group LASSO
**Grouped variables:** β = (β^(1), ..., β^(G)) where β^(g) are groups
```
min_β (1/2)||Y - Xβ||₂² + λ∑_{g=1}^G √|G_g| ||β^(g)||₂
```

**Effect:** Selects entire groups of variables together.

## 21.5 Theoretical Properties of LASSO

### Prediction Error
**Oracle inequality for LASSO:**
```
||X(β̂ - β)||₂² ≤ C₁s log p/n
```

with high probability, where s = ||β||₀.

### Variable Selection Consistency
**Irrepresentable condition:** For LASSO to select correct variables:
```
||Σ_{J^c,J}Σ_{J,J}^{-1}sign(β_J)||_∞ < 1
```

where J = {j : βⱼ ≠ 0} is true support.

### Restricted Eigenvalue Condition
**RE condition:** For some subset S and constant κ > 0:
```
min_{β∈C(S)} (β^T X^T X β)/(n||β||₂²) ≥ κ
```

where C(S) = {β : ||β_{S^c}||₁ ≤ 3||β_S||₁, β ≠ 0}

**Implication:** Ensures good behavior of LASSO estimator.

### Adaptive LASSO
**Weighted L1 penalty:**
```
min_β (1/2)||Y - Xβ||₂² + λ∑_{j=1}^p w_j|β_j|
```

where wⱼ = 1/|β̂ⱼ^{OLS}|^γ for some γ > 0.

**Oracle property:** Achieves optimal rate and correct variable selection.

## 21.6 Multiple Testing

### Multiple Testing Problem
Test p hypotheses H₁, ..., Hₚ simultaneously.

**Challenges:**
- Classical Type I error control inadequate
- Need simultaneous control over all tests
- Power considerations in high dimensions

### Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER)
```
FWER = P(reject at least one true null hypothesis)
```

**Bonferroni correction:** Reject Hⱼ if pⱼ ≤ α/p
**Holm's method:** Step-down procedure with better power

### False Discovery Rate (FDR)
```
FDR = E[V/R | R > 0]
```

where V = false discoveries, R = total discoveries.

**Benjamini-Hochberg procedure:**
1. Order p-values: p₍₁₎ ≤ ... ≤ p₍ₚ₎
2. Find largest k such that p₍ₖ₎ ≤ (k/p)α
3. Reject H₍₁₎, ..., H₍ₖ₎

### Adaptive Procedures
**Estimate π₀:** Proportion of true null hypotheses
**Adaptive BH:** Replace p with p̂ in BH procedure

### Local FDR
**Posterior probability that null is true:**
```
fdr(z) = P(H₀|Z = z)
```

**Empirical Bayes approach:** Estimate fdr(z) from data.

## 21.7 Covariance Estimation

### Sample Covariance Problems
When p > n:
- Sample covariance matrix is singular
- Eigenvalues are poor estimates
- Inverse doesn't exist

### Shrinkage Estimators

**Linear shrinkage:**
```
Σ̂ = (1-ρ)S + ρF
```

where S is sample covariance, F is target (e.g., diagonal matrix).

**Ledoit-Wolf estimator:** Optimal ρ minimizing Frobenius loss.

### Factor Models
**Model:** Σ = ΛΛᵀ + Ψ where Λ is p×k loading matrix, Ψ is diagonal.

**Benefits:**
- Dimension reduction: k << p
- Parsimony: pk + p parameters vs p(p+1)/2
- Economic interpretation

### Sparse Covariance Estimation
**Assume:** Many entries of Σ are zero (sparse precision matrix)

**Graphical LASSO:**
```
max_Θ log det(Θ) - tr(SΘ) - λ||Θ||₁
```

where Θ = Σ⁻¹ is precision matrix.

## 21.8 Principal Component Analysis

### High-Dimensional PCA
**Classical PCA:** Works when n >> p
**Challenge:** When p ≈ n or p > n, sample eigenvalues/eigenvectors unreliable

### Spiked Covariance Models
**Population covariance:**
```
Σ = ∑_{i=1}^r λᵢvᵢvᵢᵀ + σ²Iₚ
```

where λ₁ > ... > λᵣ > σ² are spike eigenvalues.

### Phase Transition Phenomena
**BBP threshold:** Spike eigenvalue λ detectable iff λ > σ²(1 + √γ)

**Below threshold:** Sample eigenvalue converges to edge of MP distribution
**Above threshold:** Sample eigenvalue tracks population eigenvalue

### Sparse PCA
**Goal:** Find sparse linear combinations with high variance

**Sparse loadings:** v with ||v||₀ ≤ s
**Optimization:** Non-convex problem, various approximations

**Methods:**
- Truncated power method
- Semidefinite relaxation
- Diagonal thresholding

### Robust PCA
**Model:** Data matrix = Low rank + Sparse + Noise
```
X = L + S + N
```

**Principal Component Pursuit:**
```
min_{L,S} ||L||_* + λ||S||₁ subject to L + S = X
```

where ||·||₊ is nuclear norm (sum of singular values).

## 21.9 Classification in High Dimensions

**Often conflicting:** Best prediction ≠ true model

### Ridge Regression
```
β̂_ridge = (XᵀX + λI)⁻¹XᵀY
```

**Properties:**
- Always well-defined (even when p > n)
- Shrinks coefficients toward zero
- Good prediction, no variable selection

### LASSO Regression
```
β̂_LASSO = argmin (1/2)||Y - Xβ||₂² + λ||β||₁
```

**Properties:**
- Variable selection through sparsity

- Selection consistency under conditions

### Post-Selection Inference
**Problem:** Standard inference invalid after variable selection

**Selective inference:** Condition on selected model
**Data splitting:** Use different data for selection and inference
**Debiased LASSO:** Correct for selection bias

## 21.11 Computational Methods

### Coordinate Descent
**LASSO coordinate descent:**
```
β̂_j ← S(∑_i x_{ij}(y_i - ∑_{k≠j} x_{ik}β̂_k), λ)/(∑_i x_{ij}²)
```

where S(z, λ) = sign(z)(|z| - λ)₊ is soft thresholding.

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- Fast convergence for LASSO
- Scales well to large p

### Proximal Gradient Methods
**General form:**
```
x^{(k+1)} = prox_{t_k g}(x^{(k)} - t_k ∇f(x^{(k)}))
```

**LASSO:** prox function is soft thresholding
**Group LASSO:** prox function is group soft thresholding

### Screening Rules
**Idea:** Identify zero coefficients without full optimization

**Basic screening:** If |XⱼᵀY| < λ, then β̂ⱼ = 0

**Advanced screening:** Use optimality conditions and geometric insights

### Distributed Computing
**Parameter server:** Distribute gradient computations
**ADMM:** Alternating direction method of multipliers
**Map-reduce:** Parallel processing frameworks

## 21.12 Minimax Theory

```

**Sparse covariance estimation:**
```
inf_{Σ̂} sup_{Σ: |supp(Σ)|≤s} E[||Σ̂ - Σ||²_F] ≍ (s log p)/n
```

```

### Theoretical Guarantees

**Sample complexity:** Need O(rn log² n) observed entries for exact recovery

### Algorithms
**Singular value thresholding:** Iterative algorithm
**Alternating least squares:** Non-convex but practical
**Gradient descent:** On manifold of fixed-rank matrices

## 21.15 Compressed Sensing

### Sparse Signal Recovery
**Model:** y = Ax + ε where x is s-sparse

**Challenge:** When A is "fat" (more columns than rows), infinitely many solutions

### Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)
**Definition:** Matrix A satisfies RIP of order s with constant δₛ if:
```
(1 - δₛ)||x||₂² ≤ ||Ax||₂² ≤ (1 + δₛ)||x||₂²
```

for all s-sparse vectors x.

**Implication:** A approximately preserves distances for sparse vectors.

### Recovery Guarantees
**Theorem:** If A satisfies RIP with δ₂ₛ < √2 - 1, then L1 minimization
```
min_x ||x||₁ subject to ||y - Ax||₂ ≤ ε
```

recovers s-sparse signals exactly (or approximately with noise).
