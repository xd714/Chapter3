# regenerate and explain more, with supporting literautres

Estimating the standard error variance of Mendelian sampling (MS) effects is critical for validating genetic evaluation models in breeding programs. Below, we expand on key methodologies with deeper technical explanations and literature support.

---

### **1. Full Model Sampling (FMS) Method**

**Concept**:
FMS quantifies uncertainty in MS estimates through **resampling techniques** (e.g., bootstrapping), which preserve the original data structure while simulating variability. This method directly measures how sampling noise affects MS effect estimates.

**Technical Details**:

- **Resampling**: Simulates $r$ datasets by randomly sampling with replacement from the original data.
- **Variance Calculation**: For each individual $i$, compute the variance of MS estimates across all replicates.
- **Formula**:

$$
\text{PEV}_{MS,i} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{j=1}^r \left(\hat{m}_{ij} - \bar{\hat{m}}_i\right)^2
$$

where $\bar{\hat{m}}_i$ is the mean MS effect for individual $i$ across replicates.

**Advantages**:

- Accounts for **non-linear interactions** between genetic and environmental effects[^2][^6].
- Validated in dairy cattle evaluations to detect biases as small as 2%[^2].

**Literature**:

- **Lidauer et al. (2007)**: Introduced FMS for animal models[^6].
- **Tyrisevä et al. (2018)**: Demonstrated its reliability in detecting inflated genetic trends[^2][^6].

---

### **2. Mendelian Sampling Variance Test (MSVT)**

**Concept**:
MSVT compares **observed MS variances** to theoretical expectations under the genetic model. It identifies inconsistencies in genetic evaluations by analyzing within-year variances.

**Key Equation**:

$$
\hat{\sigma}_u^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^q d_i \hat{m}_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^q (1 - \text{PEV}_i)}
$$

- $d_i$: Inverse of the genetic variance unexplained by parental information.
- **PEV Adjustment**: Reduces bias from estimation errors in MS effects[^3][^6].

**Implementation**:

1. Estimate within-year genetic variances using MS deviations.
2. Fit a **weighted regression model** to detect temporal trends[^2].

**Use Case**:

- Detected upward biases of 0.2 genetic standard deviations in top 1% of dairy bulls[^6].

**Literature**:

- **Tyrisevä et al. (2018)**: Validated MSVT in Nordic Holstein populations[^2][^6].

### **3. Monte Carlo Sampling for PEV**

**Approach**:
Simulates genetic values under the assumed model and compares variance components using multiple formulations:


| Formulation | Formula | Application |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **PEV~GC1~** | $\sigma_g^2 - \text{Var}(\hat{u})$ | Measures "lost" genetic variance[^3]. |
| **PEV~GC2~** | $\text{Var}(u - \hat{u})$ | Direct prediction error[^3]. |
| **PEV~FL~** | $\sigma_g^2 - \text{Cov}(u, \hat{u})$ | Adjusts for selection bias[^3]. |

**Strengths**:

- Flexible for structured populations (e.g., inbred lines)[^3].
- Compatible with single-step genomic models[^3].

**Literature**:

- **García-Cortés et al. (1995)**: Defined foundational PEV metrics[^3].
- **Fouilloux \& Laloë (2001)**: Extended for complex pedigrees[^3].

---

### **4. Delta-Method Approximation**

**Purpose**:
Estimates the standard error (SE) of **ratio-based causal effects** in Mendelian randomization.

**Formula**:
For $\beta = \frac{\beta_{ZY}}{\beta_{ZX}}$:

$$
\text{SE}(\beta) \approx \sqrt{\frac{\text{Var}(\beta_{ZY})}{\beta_{ZX}^2} + \frac{\beta_{ZY}^2 \text{Var}(\beta_{ZX})}{\beta_{ZX}^4}}
$$

**Application**:

- Widely used in epidemiology to assess gene-outcome effects[^4][^5].
- Requires large sample sizes ($N > 10,000$) for binary outcomes[^5].

**Limitations**:

- Sensitive to weak instrument bias[^4].

---

### **5. Weighted Regression for Temporal Bias Detection**

**Method**:

- Fits regression models to within-year genetic variances, weighted by MS reliability.
- Flags cohorts with inflated variances indicative of evaluation errors[^2][^6].

**Case Study**:

- Identified over-representation of young bulls in biased evaluations[^6].

---

## **Method Comparison**

| Method | Best For | Limitations |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **FMS** | Non-linear models | Computationally intensive |
| **MSVT** | Detecting temporal biases | Requires large cohort sizes |
| **Monte Carlo** | Complex pedigrees | Assumes known variance components |
| **Delta Method** | Mendelian randomization | Prone to weak instruments |


---

## **Why These Methods Matter**

Accurate MS variance estimation ensures breeding programs avoid overestimating genetic gains, which can lead to unsustainable selection practices. For example, biases as small as 2% in dairy cattle evaluations significantly alter the rankings of top bulls[^6]. These methods are now standard in genomic evaluation systems, including those used for the DU6 mouse line and Nordic Holsteins[^2][^3][^6].

# Typically what they do to calculate

The prediction error variance (PEV) of the Mendelian sampling effect is typically calculated using information from the inverse of the coefficient matrix in mixed model equations. Here's how it's normally done:

**From Mixed Model Equations:** When you solve Henderson's mixed model equations, you get the inverse of the coefficient matrix (C⁻¹). The PEV of breeding values is extracted from the diagonal elements corresponding to each animal in this inverse matrix.

**For Mendelian Sampling Effect:** The PEV of the Mendelian sampling effect for animal i is calculated as:

```
PEV(MSᵢ) = PEV(âᵢ) - 0.5 × [PEV(âₛ) + PEV(âₐ)]
```

Where:

- PEV(âᵢ) = prediction error variance of animal i's breeding value
- PEV(âₛ) = prediction error variance of sire's breeding value
- PEV(âₐ) = prediction error variance of dam's breeding value

**Alternative formulation:**

```
PEV(MSᵢ) = σ²ₐ × (1 - RELᵢ) - 0.25 × σ²ₐ × [(1 - RELₛ) + (1 - RELₐ)]
```

Where REL is the reliability (1 - PEV/σ²ₐ).

**Practical implementation:** Most software packages (like BLUPF90, ASReml, etc.) provide these PEV values directly from the mixed model solutions. The inverse of the left-hand side matrix contains the prediction error variances on its diagonal.

**For genomic evaluations:** With genomic information, the calculation becomes more complex as it involves the genomic relationship matrix (G) and may require inversion of large matrices or approximation methods.

The key is that you need the full inverse of the coefficient matrix from your mixed model analysis to get accurate PEV estimates for the Mendelian sampling effects.

# the inverse of A (A⁻¹) is **not** the same as the inverse of the coefficient matrix (C⁻¹) from mixed model equations.

**A⁻¹ is:**

- The inverse of the numerator relationship matrix
- Used to construct the coefficient matrix in Henderson's mixed model equations
- Represents the inverse of the additive genetic relationships between animals

**C⁻¹ is:**

- The inverse of the entire coefficient matrix from Henderson's mixed model equations
- Much larger matrix that includes both fixed and random effects
- Contains the prediction error variances (PEV) on its diagonal

**The relationship:** In Henderson's mixed model equations, the coefficient matrix C has the structure:

```
C = [X'R⁻¹X    X'R⁻¹Z  ]
    [Z'R⁻¹X    Z'R⁻¹Z + A⁻¹/σ²ₑ × σ²ₐ]
```

Where:

- X = design matrix for fixed effects
- Z = design matrix for random effects (breeding values)
- R⁻¹ = inverse of residual covariance matrix
- A⁻¹ = inverse of numerator relationship matrix
- σ²ₑ, σ²ₐ = residual and additive genetic variances

**For PEV calculation:** You need C⁻¹ (the full inverse), not just A⁻¹. The PEV values come from the diagonal elements of C⁻¹ corresponding to the breeding value equations.

So A⁻¹ is a component used to build C, but C⁻¹ is what you need for prediction error variances of breeding values and Mendelian sampling effects.
