# give me literatures support  de-regressed breeding value as phenotypes in GWAS. such two steps approach used by literatures

The use of de-regressed breeding values (DEBV or DRP) as phenotypes in GWAS is a well-established two-step approach in animal genetics. This method is especially valuable when direct phenotypes are unavailable or when traits are difficult to measure. Here’s how the approach is supported in the literature:

## Two-Step Approach

**Step 1: Estimation and Deregression of Breeding Values**

- Estimated breeding values (EBV) are first calculated using pedigree and/or genomic information.
- These EBVs are then *de-regressed* to remove ancestral and parental contributions, yielding de-regressed proofs (DRP) or de-regressed EBVs (DEBV). This process ensures that the resulting values are as close as possible to the individual's own genetic merit, minimizing double counting of information from related animals[^6][^7][^8].

**Step 2: GWAS Using De-regressed Values as Phenotypes**

- The de-regressed values are used as pseudo-phenotypes in GWAS, regressed on SNP genotypes to identify loci associated with the trait of interest.
- This approach is particularly useful for traits with low heritability, binary traits, or traits where phenotyping is logistically challenging[^1][^3][^5].


## Literature Support

- **Garrick et al. (2009)** provide a comprehensive methodological framework for deregressing EBVs and explain the importance of appropriate weighting in downstream genomic analyses. They show that deregressed EBVs, weighted by their information content, are suitable for use as phenotypes in GWAS and genomic prediction[^6][^7].
- **van den Berg et al. (2015)** performed GWAS for cryptorchidism and hernia in pigs using de-regressed EBVs as phenotypes. They found this approach powerful for detecting QTLs for traits where direct phenotyping of all animals was not feasible[^1][^3].
- **Song et al. (2017)** and **García-Ruiz et al. (2014)** compared the accuracy and bias of genomic prediction using EBVs versus de-regressed EBVs as response variables, confirming that de-regressed values reduce double counting and improve the precision of GWAS results[^2][^5].
- **Interbull Bulletin (2014)** and **OUP G3 Journal (2014)** discuss the rationale for using de-regressed EBVs in multi-step genomic evaluations and GWAS, highlighting their widespread adoption in international genetic evaluations[^4][^8].


## Example from the Literature

> “A single SNP GWAS was performed... applying the following model:
> DEBV_ijw = μ + SNP_i + a_j + e_ij,
> where DEBV_ijw is the de-regressed EBV for genotyped animal j... The weighting factor w was used in the GWAS to account for differences in the amount of available information on offspring to estimate DEBV.”
> — van den Berg et al., 2015[^1][^3]

## Summary Table

| Step | Description | Key References |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Calculate and deregress EBVs | [^6][^7][^8] |
| 2 | Use de-regressed EBVs as phenotypes in GWAS | [^1][^3][^5] |

**In summary:**
The two-step use of de-regressed breeding values as GWAS phenotypes is widely supported in animal genetics literature for its ability to provide unbiased, individual-specific genetic signals, especially in structured populations or for traits with limited phenotyping[^1][^3][^6][^7][^8].
