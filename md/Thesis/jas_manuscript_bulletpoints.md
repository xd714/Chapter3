## INTRODUCTION

• Selection theory predicts genetic variance depletion through allele fixation and drift (Falconer and Mackay, 1996; Hill, 1982)
• Response should plateau after dozens of generations as additive variance exhausts (Robertson, 1960; Bulmer, 1971)
• Simulation studies demonstrate steepest variance loss under strong selection and small population sizes (Lynch and Walsh, 1998; Walsh and Lynch, 2018)
• Empirical studies show variance persistence beyond theoretical expectations (Keightley and Hill, 1992; Weber and Diggins, 1990)
• Long-term Drosophila experiments demonstrate ongoing selection gain after hundreds of generations (Weber and Diggins, 1990)
• Commercial livestock maintain substantial genetic variability despite intense selection (Hill, 2016)
• Multiple mechanisms contribute including incomplete fixation, residual segregation at small-effect loci, and epistatic interactions (Weber and Diggins, 1990)
• Mutation contributes minimally over realistic breeding timescales (Mulder et al., 2019; Hill, 2016)
• Recent genomic studies reveal balancing selection and fluctuating selection maintaining diversity (Wientjes et al., 2023)
• Advances in genome-wide genotyping enable dissection of variance sources previously masked by pedigree-based analyses (Meuwissen et al., 2020)
• Variance persistence affects breeding program sustainability and future potential (Hill, 2016)
• DU6 population provides unique model for studying long-term selection effects in mammals
• Objective: quantify genetic variance after 200+ generations of intense body weight selection using both pedigree and genomic approaches

## RESULTS

• Substantial additive genetic variance persisted across all traits despite 200+ generations of selection
• Heritability estimates: 0.20 ± 0.03 for BW42m, 0.21 ± 0.03 for BW42f, 0.13 ± 0.04 for LS
• Heritabilities comparable to base populations of many livestock species (Falconer and Mackay, 1996)
• Strong positive genetic correlation between male and female body weight (0.82 ± 0.089) validates sex-limited selection strategy
• Near-zero genetic correlations between body weight traits and litter size (0.04 ± 0.18 and 0.12 ± 0.18) indicate minimal antagonistic relationships
• Refined deregression method improved reliability estimates dramatically from 0.15 to 0.38 (2-fold improvement)
• Enhanced weight estimates provided substantially more accurate pseudo-phenotypes for genomic analysis (Garrick et al., 2009)
• GWAS using mlma module identified significant associations for body weight traits on chromosome 19
• Results differed from previous literature findings and earlier results in this population
• Average inbreeding coefficient reached 0.16 in recent generations
• Mendelian sampling variance maintained despite extreme inbreeding levels contradicting theoretical predictions (Bulmer, 1971)

## DISCUSSION

### Persistence of Genetic Variance Under Extreme Selection

• Genetic variance persisted far beyond theoretical predictions after 191 generations of intensive selection (Robertson, 1960; Bulmer, 1971)
• Heritabilities (0.20 for body weight) remained comparable to base populations in livestock species (Hill, 2016)
• Persistence primarily attributable to Mendelian sampling variance within families highlighting critical role of within-family genetic segregation (Falconer and Mackay, 1996)
• Maintenance despite extreme inbreeding levels (F = 0.16) challenges conventional understanding of selection limits (Lynch and Walsh, 1998)
• Contributing mechanisms include incomplete linkage between causal variants and markers, continued segregation at loci with small individual effects (Weber and Diggins, 1990)
• Potential contribution of new mutations or epigenetic variation cannot be excluded (Hill, 2016)
• Strong genetic correlation (0.82 ± 0.089) validated sex-limited selection strategy effectiveness demonstrating shared genetic architecture between sexes
• Findings support continued genetic gain achievable through optimized strategies even in highly inbred populations (Meuwissen et al., 2020)

### Methodological Contributions for Genomic Evaluation

• Refined deregression approach represents significant methodological advancement for genomic analysis in highly structured populations (Garrick et al., 2009)
• Dramatic reliability improvement (0.15 to 0.38) demonstrates critical importance of properly accounting for complex relationship structures and Mendelian sampling prediction error variance
• Key improvements include accurate information content assessment and proper weighting of information from various sources while accounting for dependencies among relatives (Henderson, 1984)
• Appropriate reliability estimation incorporating Mendelian sampling PEV provides realistic breeding value accuracy estimates in highly inbred populations
• Enhanced genomic analysis through more accurate pseudo-phenotypes improves GWAS power and reduces false discovery rates (Hong and Park, 2012)
• Methodological advances particularly relevant for livestock breeding programs working with closed populations, endangered breeds, or species with extensive relationship matrices (VanRaden, 2008)
• Traditional approaches may provide misleading results where complex pedigree structures exist (Garrick et al., 2009)

### Population Management and Breeding Strategy Implications

• Long-term selection sustainability suggests genetic progress can continue far longer than traditionally expected even in highly inbred populations (Hill, 2016)
• Findings indicate apparent selection plateaus may be overcome through improved breeding system design rather than reaching absolute genetic limits (Weber and Diggins, 1990)
• Persistence of genetic variance suggests selection intensity can be maintained longer than typically assumed provided breeding strategies maintain Mendelian sampling variance (Falconer and Mackay, 1996)
• While extreme inbreeding levels may be tolerable in some contexts, slight negative correlations with litter size warrant continued monitoring of reproductive performance
• Balancing genetic gain with diversity preservation remains crucial for long-term sustainability (Lynch and Walsh, 1998)
• Direct relevance for livestock breeding programs facing similar challenges in closed populations with limited genetic diversity
• Closed population management in breeds with limited genetic diversity can potentially achieve continued genetic progress through optimized breeding strategies that maximize Mendelian sampling variance (Meuwissen et al., 2020)
• Results have important implications for breeding program design where maintaining genetic variance is critical for sustained improvement (Hill, 2016)
