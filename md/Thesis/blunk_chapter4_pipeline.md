# Chapter 4: GWAS Implementation with Estimated Parent-of-Origin Effects

## Blunk's Technical Pipeline - Genomic Mapping Phase

---

## CHAPTER 4: GENOMIC DISCOVERY (ePOE-based GWAS Innovation)

### Principle: "Molecular Discovery Through Statistical Innovation" - Leverage estimated POEs as pseudo-phenotypes to identify imprinted loci without expensive progeny genotyping

#### Scientific Principle

**"Statistical Genetics Bridge"** - Transform quantitative genetic predictions into molecular genetic discoveries by using estimated parent-of-origin effects as summary statistics for genome-wide association analysis.

#### Innovation Strategy:

- **Challenge Recognition:** Traditional GWAS requires phased genotypes and phenotyped individuals
- **Reality Constraint:** Slaughtered offspring lack genotypes, phase often unknown
- **Innovation Solution:** Use ePOEs from parents as pseudo-phenotypes
- **Technical Implementation:** Deregression and weighting of ePOEs for unbiased association

# Innovation Opportunity Recognition
innovation_opportunity = """
Key Insight: Parent-of-Origin Effects contain loci information

Traditional Approach:
Individual phenotype ~ Individual genotype (phased)
Problems: Expensive, limited sample, phase uncertainty

Novel Approach:
Parent ePOE ~ Parent genotype (unphased)
Advantages: Cheaper, larger sample, no phase needed

Theoretical Foundation:
If ePOE captures imprinting effects from progeny, then:
ePOE should associate with imprinted loci in parent genome
Association strength proportional to loci effect size
Unphased genotypes sufficient (simple gene counts)
"""
```

### **Step 2: ePOE-based GWAS Methodology Development**

```python
# Methodological Framework
epoe_gwas_framework = """
ePOE-based GWAS Methodology:

Core Innovation:
Use estimated Parent-of-Origin Effects as dependent variables
Regress ePOEs on unphased parental genotypes
Test for significant associations genome-wide

Mathematical Model:
ePOE_i = μ + β × SNP_i + u_i + e_i

where:
- ePOE_i = estimated POE for parent i (from Chapter 3 analysis)
- SNP_i = genotype count {0,1,2} for parent i
- β = allelic effect (test parameter)
- u_i ~ N(0, A σ²_u) = polygenic random effects
- e_i ~ N(0, W⁻¹ σ²_e) = residual effects (weighted)

Key Advantages:
1. No phasing required (uses simple gene counts)
2. Large sample sizes possible (parents vs. progeny)
3. No expensive progeny genotyping needed
4. Utilizes all breeding value information
"""

# Deregression and Weighting Theory
deregression_theory = """
ePOE Correction for GWAS Application:

Problem: ePOEs include parent average (PA) information
Solution: Deregression to remove PA bias (Garrick et al. 2009)

Deregression Process:
1. Calculate PA-corrected ePOE:
   ePOE*_i = (ePOE_i - PA_i) / r²*_i
   
2. Adjust reliability after PA removal:
   r²*_i = (r²_i - r²_PA) / (1 - r²_PA)
   
3. Weight observations by information content:
   w_i = r²*_i / (c + (1-r²*_i)/r²*_i)

where c = parameter controlling polygenic variance proportion

Mathematical Foundation (adapted from Garrick et al. 2009):
- Removes parent average to avoid double-counting
- Weights by Mendelian sampling information content
- Accounts for heterogeneous variance across individuals
- Enables unbiased association testing
