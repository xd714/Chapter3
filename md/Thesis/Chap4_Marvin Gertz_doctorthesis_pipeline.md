**"Infrastructure Reuse and Innovation"** - Leverage established genomic infrastructure for gene discovery, while innovating methods for challenging data characteristics.

#### Innovation Strategy:

- **Infrastructure Reuse:** Use same genotype/phenotype data from Chapter 3
- **Methodological Innovation:** Develop reliability-based animal filtering
- **Gene Discovery:** Identify genomic regions affecting economically important traits
- **Method Validation:** Test filtering effectiveness vs. traditional approaches
