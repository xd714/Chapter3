# Garrick's Method and Mendelian Sampling PEV: Mathematical Derivation

## Step 1: Decomposition of Breeding Value

An animal's true breeding value can be decomposed as:

```
g_i = PA_i + MS_i
```

Where:
- `g_i` = true breeding value of animal i
- `PA_i` = parent average effect = (g_sire + g_dam)/2
- `MS_i` = Mendelian sampling effect

**Variance Components:**

Since PA_i and MS_i are **independent** by definition (Mendelian sampling is the random deviation from parent average):

```
var(g_i) = var(PA_i) + var(MS_i)
```

From quantitative genetics theory:
- `var(PA_i) = 0.5σ²_g` (half the additive genetic variance)
- `var(MS_i) = 0.5σ²_g` (half the additive genetic variance)

Therefore:
```
σ²_g = 0.5σ²_g + 0.5σ²_g ✓
```

## Step 2: EBV as Predictor of True BV

An estimated breeding value (EBV) can be written as:
```
ĝ_i = g_i + e_i
```

Where `e_i` is the prediction error with:
```
var(e_i) = (1 - r²_i)σ²_g
```

The reliability is:
```
r²_i = var(ĝ_i)/σ²_g = cov(ĝ_i, g_i)/σ²_g
```

## Step 3: Parent Average Information in EBV

The EBV contains information from three sources:
1. Parent average information
2. Individual's own information  
3. Progeny information

The EBV can be expressed as:
```
ĝ_i = b_PA · PA_i + b_own · y_i + b_prog · prog_info_i
```

Where the weights depend on the information content and relationships.

## Step 4: Deregression Problem

**Problem:** EBV shrinks observations toward the mean by factor r²_i

The regression of EBV on true BV is:
```
β(ĝ_i, g_i) = r²_i ≤ 1
```

**Solution:** Inflate EBV by deregression factor:
```
g*_i = ĝ_i/r²_i
```

## Step 5: Variance of Deregressed EBV

The variance of deregressed EBV becomes:
```
var(g*_i) = var(ĝ_i/r²_i) = var(ĝ_i)/(r²_i)²
```

Since `var(ĝ_i) = r²_i · σ²_g`:
```
var(g*_i) = (r²_i · σ²_g)/(r²_i)² = σ²_g/r²_i
```

## Step 6: Removing Parent Average Effects

To remove parent average effects, we need to solve:

```
[Z'_PA·Z_PA + λ    Z'_PA·Z_i  ] [ĝ_PA]   [y*_PA]
[Z'_i·Z_PA         Z'_i·Z_i + λ] [ĝ_i ]  = [y*_i ]
```

Where:
- `λ = (1-h²)/h²` 
- `Z'_PA·Z_PA` and `Z'_i·Z_i` are information content matrices

**Key equations from the paper:**
```
r²_PA = 0.5 - λ·c_PA,PA
r²_i = 1.0 - λ·c_i,i
```

## Step 7: Mendelian Sampling PEV Calculation

The information content for Mendelian sampling effect is:
```
Z'_MS·Z_MS = Z'_i·Z_i - Z'_PA·Z_PA/4
```

**From equations (12) and (13) in the paper:**
```
Z'_i·Z_i = r²_i/(1.0 - r²_i) · λ
Z'_PA·Z_PA = r²_PA/(0.5 - r²_PA) · λ
```

**Mendelian Sampling Information:**
```
Z'_MS·Z_MS = r²_i/(1.0 - r²_i) · λ - [r²_PA/(0.5 - r²_PA) · λ]/4
```

## Step 8: PEV of Mendelian Sampling Effect

The prediction error variance of the Mendelian sampling effect is:
```
PEV(MS_i) = σ²_MS / (1 + Z'_MS·Z_MS/λ)
```

Where `σ²_MS = 0.5σ²_g` (Mendelian sampling variance)

**Substituting:**
```
PEV(MS_i) = 0.5σ²_g / (1 + Z'_MS·Z_MS/λ)
```

## Step 9: Deregressed Information Free of PA

The deregressed information excluding parent average is:
```
g*_i,no_PA = y*_i / Z'_i·Z_i
```

With corresponding reliability:
```
r²*_i = 1.0 - λ/(Z'_i·Z_i + λ)
```

## Step 10: Final Weighting Formula

The appropriate weight for deregressed breeding values is:
```
w_i = (1 - h²)/[(c + (1 - r²*_i)/r²*_i) · h²]
```

Where:
- `c` = fraction of genetic variance not explained by markers
- `r²*_i` = reliability of information free of parent average effects

**This weight accounts for:**
1. The uncertainty in the Mendelian sampling effect estimation
2. The heterogeneous variance of deregressed observations
3. The fraction of genetic variance captured by genomic markers

## Connection to Mendelian Sampling PEV

The PEV of Mendelian sampling effects directly influences:

1. **The reliability calculation:** `r²*_i` depends on how precisely we can estimate the MS effect
2. **The weighting formula:** Higher PEV(MS) → Lower reliability → Lower weight
3. **The deregression factor:** Accounts for uncertainty in separating PA from MS effects

The mathematical framework ensures that genomic predictions properly account for the uncertainty in estimating Mendelian sampling effects when using family information.
