# Refined Research Methodology: Genetic Variance Persistence in DU6 Mouse Line

## Executive Summary

This refined methodology addresses the central paradox of persistent genetic variance in the DU6 mouse line despite 200+ generations of intense selection and high inbreeding (F > 0.85). The approach has been updated to address practical challenges encountered in previous analyses and incorporates improved methods for deregressed proofs calculation using Mendelian sampling prediction error variance.

## Core Research Questions

1. **Variance Paradox**: How does additive genetic variance for body mass at 42 days (BM42) persist despite extreme inbreeding levels?
2. **Genomic Architecture**: Which genomic regions contribute to remaining genetic variation, and what are their effect sizes?
3. **Bottleneck Impact**: How did the facility transfer bottleneck affect genetic diversity and population structure?
4. **Selection Dynamics**: What maintains the selection response under extreme population constraints?
5. **Fertility-Selection Trade-off**: How does continued selection for BM42 impact reproductive fitness?
6. **Breeding Strategy**: What is the optimal approach for balancing genetic gain with population sustainability?

## Phase 1: Quantitative Genetic Analysis - Refined Approach

### 1.1: Temporal Variance Component Analysis

**Enhanced Objectives:**
- Track additive genetic variance changes across pre-bottleneck, bottleneck, and post-bottleneck periods
- Distinguish between true genetic variance depletion vs. model misspecification artifacts
- Account for environmental variance changes during facility transfer

**Methodological Improvements:**

**Problem Addressed:** Previous sliding window analysis showed unstable variance estimates due to small sample sizes within generations.

**Solution - Multi-Generation Pooling:**
- Use 15-generation windows with 10-generation overlaps for stable estimates
- Implement environmental period effects to account for facility differences
- Apply restricted maximum likelihood with convergence diagnostics

**Enhanced Model Structure:**
```
BM42 ~ μ + sex + litter_size + dam_age + facility_period + 
       generation_within_period + animal + litter + ε

Random Effects:
- animal ~ N(0, A×σ²ₐ)  # Additive genetic effect
- litter ~ N(0, I×σ²ₗ)   # Common litter environment
- ε ~ N(0, I×σ²ₑ)        # Residual variance
```

**Variance Partitioning Strategy:**
- **Period 1**: Generations 120-150 (pre-bottleneck, family selection)
- **Period 2**: Generations 151-155 (bottleneck period)
- **Period 3**: Generations 156-200 (post-bottleneck, BLUP+OCS)

### 1.2: Genomic vs. Pedigree-Based Variance Decomposition

**Problem Addressed:** Standard GBLUP models may not capture all genetic variance in highly inbred populations due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium.

**Enhanced Approach:**
- Partition genomic variance into genic and linkage disequilibrium components
- Use multiple genomic relationship matrices with different MAF thresholds
- Implement single-step genomic BLUP to combine pedigree and genomic information

**Variance Component Models:**
1. **Pedigree-only model**: Estimates σ²ₐ(total)
2. **Genomic model (all SNPs)**: Estimates σ²ₐ(genomic)
3. **Genomic model (MAF>0.05)**: Estimates σ²ₐ(common variants)
4. **Single-step model**: Estimates σ²ₐ(combined)

**Key Metrics:**
- Genomic heritability: h²ᵍ = σ²ₐ(genomic) / σ²ₚ
- Proportion captured by SNPs: σ²ₐ(genomic) / σ²ₐ(pedigree)
- Missing heritability: σ²ₐ(pedigree) - σ²ₐ(genomic)

## Phase 2: Deregressed Proof Calculation - Garrick et al. (2009) Method

### 2.1: Enhanced EBV Calculation with Reliable Accuracy Estimation

**Critical Challenge:** Standard deregression methods fail in highly inbred populations where parent average reliability approaches unity, leading to over-deregression artifacts.

**Garrick et al. (2009) Implementation:**

**Step 1: Calculate EBVs with Prediction Error Variance**
- Use animal model BLUP with full pedigree relationship matrix
- Extract prediction error variance (PEV) for each animal from the inverse of the mixed model equations coefficient matrix
- Calculate EBV reliability: rel = 1 - (PEV / σ²ₐ)

**Step 2: Mendelian Sampling Variance Calculation**
Following Garrick et al. (2009), the Mendelian sampling variance for animal i is:

```
PEVᵢ = PEV of animal i from BLUP analysis
PEVₛ = PEV of sire (0 if unknown)  
PEVₐ = PEV of dam (0 if unknown)
PEVₚₐ = 0.5 × (PEVₛ + PEVₐ) if both parents known
       = 0.25 × σ²ₐ if one parent unknown
       = 0.5 × σ²ₐ if both parents unknown

Mendelian Sampling PEV = PEVᵢ - PEVₚₐ
Mendelian Sampling Reliability = 1 - (MS_PEV / σ²ₐ)
```

**Step 3: Deregressed Proof Calculation**
```
Parent Average (PA) = 0.5 × (EBVₛᵢᵣₑ + EBVₐₐₘ)
Deregressed EBV (DRP) = PA + [(EBVᵢ - PA) / Mendelian_Sampling_Reliability]
DRP Weight = Mendelian_Sampling_Reliability / (1 - Mendelian_Sampling_Reliability)
```

**Quality Control for DRP:**
- Remove animals with Mendelian sampling reliability < 0.1
- Flag animals with |DRP| > 4 standard deviations for inspection
- Verify DRP variance > EBV variance (successful deregression indicator)

### 2.2: Population-Specific Adjustments

**Problem:** The DU6 population's extreme inbreeding and limited family structure creates challenges for standard deregression.

**Adjustments:**
1. **Phantom Parent Groups**: Use genetic groups for unknown founders to improve parent average accuracy
2. **Genomic-Enhanced PEV**: Incorporate genomic information to improve PEV estimation accuracy
3. **Weighted Deregression**: Apply population-specific weights based on family size and inbreeding level

## Phase 3: Genome-Wide Association Study - Enhanced Protocol

### 3.1: Population Structure and Quality Control

**Problem Addressed:** Previous analyses showed population stratification artifacts and low power due to extreme allele frequency spectrum.

**Enhanced QC Pipeline:**
- **Marker Selection**: Use relaxed MAF threshold (>0.005) due to population structure
- **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**: Apply inbreeding-adjusted HWE test
- **Population Stratification**: Use genomic principal components + family structure correction
- **Linkage Disequilibrium**: Prune markers based on LD patterns specific to inbred populations

### 3.2: GWAS Model Selection and Implementation

**Enhanced Mixed Linear Model:**
```
DRP ~ μ + SNP + PC₁ + PC₂ + PC₃ + family_group + u + ε
where:
- u ~ N(0, G×σ²ᵤ) or u ~ N(0, A×σ²ᵤ) depending on model
- family_group accounts for major family effects
- PC₁₋₃ control for population stratification
```

**Model Comparisons:**
1. **Standard MLM**: Uses genomic relationship matrix (G)
2. **Pedigree MLM**: Uses pedigree relationship matrix (A)  
3. **Single-step MLM**: Uses combined H matrix
4. **Family-corrected**: Includes explicit family effects

**Statistical Framework:**
- Multiple testing correction: Bonferroni and FDR methods
- Genomic inflation factor (λ) monitoring
- Permutation testing for empirical significance thresholds

### 3.3: Effect Size Estimation and Variance Explained

**Enhanced Interpretation:**
- Calculate proportion of genetic variance explained by significant SNPs
- Estimate effect sizes in phenotypic standard deviation units
- Assess contribution of rare vs. common variants to total genetic variance
- Validate significant associations using independent family-based tests

## Phase 4: Mendelian Sampling Variance and Selection Potential

### 4.1: Within-Family Genetic Variance Assessment

**Problem Addressed:** Previous estimates of Mendelian sampling variance were inflated by environmental effects and measurement error.

**Refined Approach:**
- Use variance of EBVs within full-sib families as direct estimate
- Correct for finite family size bias
- Account for selection within families when calculating unbiased estimates

**Key Calculations:**
```
For each full-sib family j with nⱼ offspring:
σ²ₘₛ(family j) = Var(EBVᵢ|family j) × [nⱼ/(nⱼ-1)]

Population σ²ₘₛ = Weighted average across families
Weight = family size × average reliability

Expected σ²ₘₛ(theoretical) = 0.5 × σ²ₐ × (1 - F̄parents)
where F̄parents = average inbreeding of parents
```

### 4.2: Selection Response Prediction

**Enhanced Framework:**
- Predict selection response using effective population size and Mendelian sampling variance
- Account for finite population size effects on selection intensity
- Model genetic drift effects on allele frequency changes

**Selection Limit Assessment:**
```
Selection Limit = Current population mean + (√σ²ₘₛ × selection intensity)
Generations to plateau = -ln(0.1) / (selection intensity²/ (2×Nₑ))
```

## Phase 5: Bottleneck Analysis and Population Genomics

### 5.1: Demographic History Reconstruction

**Problem Addressed:** Previous analyses couldn't distinguish bottleneck effects from selection effects on allele frequencies.

**Enhanced Methods:**
- Allele frequency spectrum analysis comparing pre/post bottleneck periods
- Effective population size estimation using linkage disequilibrium decay
- Founder contribution analysis through genomic segments

**Bottleneck Severity Metrics:**
- Genetic diversity loss: (Hₑ(pre) - Hₑ(post)) / Hₑ(pre)
- Allelic richness change across frequency spectrum
- Linkage disequilibrium increase post-bottleneck

### 5.2: Selection vs. Drift Partitioning

**Approach:**
- Compare observed allele frequency changes to neutral drift expectations
- Identify genomic regions showing selection signatures vs. drift patterns
- Quantify selection coefficients for regions associated with BM42

## Phase 6: Fertility-Inbreeding Analysis - Comprehensive Framework

### 6.1: Multi-trait Inbreeding Depression Modeling

**Problem Addressed:** Previous analyses confounded inbreeding effects with temporal trends and environmental changes.

**Enhanced Models:**
- Separate recent vs. ancient inbreeding effects using ROH segment length
- Account for environmental period effects during facility transfer
- Model non-linear inbreeding depression relationships

**Fertility Trait Battery:**

- Conception rate per mating
- Offspring survival to weaning

### 6.2: Critical Threshold Identification

**Approach:**
- Use segmented regression to identify inbreeding breakpoints
- Calculate population viability metrics under different scenarios
- Develop early warning indicators for fertility collapse

## Phase 7: Breeding Strategy Optimization

### 7.1: Multi-objective Selection Framework

**Enhanced Approach:**
- Develop economic selection index incorporating fertility costs
- Implement genomic optimal contribution selection (GOCS)
- Balance short-term genetic gain with long-term population sustainability

**Selection Index Components:**
```
I = w₁×EBV(BM42) + w₂×EBV(fertility) + w₃×(-inbreeding_penalty)
where weights are derived from economic analysis and sustainability constraints
```

### 7.2: Scenario Planning and Risk Assessment

**Future Breeding Scenarios:**
1. **Status Quo**: Continue current selection intensity
2. **Reduced Intensity**: Lower selection pressure to maintain fertility
3. **Multi-trait**: Include fertility in selection index
4. **Introgression**: Introduce new genetic material from related lines

**Risk Metrics:**
- Probability of fertility collapse within 20 generations
- Time to selection plateau under different strategies
- Genetic diversity loss rate under each scenario
