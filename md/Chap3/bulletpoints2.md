## INTRODUCTION

### Historical and Theoretical Context

• Genomic selection revolutionized animal breeding with scientific and industrial impact over the past two decades (Meuwissen et al., 2001; Gianola and Rosa, 2015) • Main methodological improvement was inclusion of genomic information for more precise kinship estimation compared to conventional pedigree-based BLUP (Gianola and Rosa, 2015) • SNP markers enable consideration of Mendelian sampling variance previously unaccounted for in traditional evaluations (Falconer and Mackay, 1996) • Genomic breeding values provide higher reliability and enable early selection compared to parent average methods (Meuwissen et al., 2001)

### Quantitative Genetics Theory and Selection Limits

• Classical selection theory predicts genetic variance depletion through allele fixation and drift in closed populations (Falconer and Mackay, 1996; Hill, 1982) • Robertson (1960) and Bulmer (1971) formalized that response should plateau after dozens to hundreds of generations as additive variance exhausts • Theoretical models predict steepest variance loss in early generations, particularly under strong selection and small population sizes (Lynch and Walsh, 1998; Walsh and Lynch, 2018) • Selection limit reached when genetic variance approaches zero due to fixation of favorable alleles (Robertson, 1960)

### Empirical Evidence Challenging Theory

• Extended selection experiments frequently document variance persistence beyond theoretical expectations (Keightley and Hill, 1992; Weber and Diggins, 1990) • Long-term Drosophila experiments demonstrate ongoing selection gain after hundreds of generations despite theoretical predictions (Weber and Diggins, 1990) • Commercial livestock populations maintain substantial genetic variability despite decades of intense directional selection (Hill, 2016) • Mouse selection experiments show continued response far beyond predicted limits (Keightley and Hill, 1992)

### Mechanisms of Variance Persistence

• Multiple biological mechanisms may account for sustained variance including incomplete fixation and residual segregation at many small-effect loci (Weber and Diggins, 1990) • Epistatic interactions and linkage between selected and neutral loci contribute to variance maintenance (Lynch and Walsh, 1998) • Mutation introduces new genetic variance but contributes minimally over realistic breeding timescales (Mulder et al., 2019; Hill, 2016) • Recent genomic studies reveal balancing selection and fluctuating selection regimes maintaining diversity at some loci (Wientjes et al., 2023)

### Methodological Advances Enabling New Insights

• Advances in genome-wide genotyping and simulation enable dissection of variance sources previously masked by pedigree-based analyses (Meuwissen et al., 2020) • Genomic relationship matrices provide more accurate kinship estimation than pedigree-based methods (VanRaden, 2008) • Deregression methods remove parent average information to create pseudo-phenotypes for genomic analysis (Garrick et al., 2009) • GWAS techniques enable identification of specific loci contributing to traits and variance (Hong and Park, 2012)

### Practical Implications for Breeding Programs

• Variance persistence has profound implications for sustainability and future potential of experimental and commercial breeding programs (Hill, 2016) • If genetic variance is rapidly depleted, progress must plateau restricting improvement and risking population viability • If cryptic variance remains undetected by classical theory, continued genetic gain may be achievable through optimized strategies (Meuwissen et al., 2020) • Understanding variance components critical for designing sustainable long-term breeding programs

### The DU6 Model System

• DU6 mouse population represents one of longest-running selection experiments in mammals with over 200 generations of documented selection • Population maintained under controlled conditions enabling precise genetic parameter estimation • Unique opportunity to test theoretical predictions against empirical reality in extreme selection scenario • Model system relevance extends to livestock breeding facing similar challenges of maintaining genetic progress in closed populations

### Study Objectives and Significance

• Primary objective: quantify remaining genetic and genomic variance after 200+ generations of intense body weight selection • Test theoretical predictions of variance depletion against empirical observations • Evaluate methodological approaches for genomic analysis in highly structured populations • Provide insights for sustainable breeding program management and selection strategy optimization • Contribute to understanding of long-term selection response mechanisms

## RESULTS

### Genetic Parameter Estimates

• Substantial additive genetic variance persisted across all traits despite 200+ generations of intensive selection • Heritability estimates: 0.20 ± 0.03 for BW42m, 0.21 ± 0.03 for BW42f, 0.13 ± 0.04 for LS • Heritabilities remained comparable to base populations of many livestock species contradicting theoretical expectations (Falconer and Mackay, 1996) • Genetic variance persistence primarily attributable to Mendelian sampling variance within families

### Genetic Correlations and Selection Response

• Strong positive genetic correlation between male and female body weight (0.82 ± 0.089) validates sex-limited selection strategy effectiveness • High correlation demonstrates shared genetic architecture between sexes enabling efficient correlated response • Near-zero genetic correlations between body weight traits and litter size (0.04 ± 0.18 and 0.12 ± 0.18) indicate minimal antagonistic relationships • Results support continued selection potential without compromising reproductive performance

### Methodological Improvements

• Refined deregression method achieved dramatic reliability improvement from 0.15 to 0.38 (2-fold increase) • Enhanced approach properly accounts for complex relationship structures and Mendelian sampling prediction error variance (Garrick et al., 2009) • Improved weight estimates provided substantially more accurate pseudo-phenotypes for genomic analysis • Method particularly valuable for highly structured populations where traditional approaches may be misleading

### Genomic Analysis Results

• GWAS using mlma module identified significant associations for body weight traits on chromosome 19 • Results differed from previous literature findings and earlier results in this population suggesting dynamic QTL landscape • Enhanced genomic analysis through improved pseudo-phenotypes increased GWAS power and reduced false discovery rates (Hong and Park, 2012) • Findings demonstrate importance of methodological refinements for accurate genomic association studies

### Population Structure and Inbreeding

• Average inbreeding coefficient reached 0.16 in recent generations representing extreme levels by livestock standards • Despite extreme inbreeding, Mendelian sampling variance maintained contradicting theoretical predictions (Bulmer, 1971) • Population structure analysis reveals continued genetic diversity at molecular level • Results challenge conventional understanding of inbreeding effects on genetic variance

## DISCUSSION

### Persistence of Genetic Variance Under Extreme Selection

• **Challenging Theoretical Predictions**: Genetic variance persisted far beyond theoretical predictions after 191 generations of intensive selection (Robertson, 1960; Bulmer, 1971) • **Maintained Heritabilities**: Heritabilities (0.20 for body weight) remained comparable to base populations in livestock species despite extreme selection pressure (Hill, 2016) • **Mendelian Sampling Role**: Persistence primarily attributable to Mendelian sampling variance within families highlighting critical role of within-family genetic segregation (Falconer and Mackay, 1996) • **Extreme Inbreeding Tolerance**: Maintenance despite extreme inbreeding levels (F = 0.16) challenges conventional understanding of selection limits and inbreeding depression (Lynch and Walsh, 1998) • **Biological Mechanisms**: Contributing mechanisms include incomplete linkage between causal variants and markers used for relationship estimation, continued segregation at loci with small individual effects (Weber and Diggins, 1990) • **Novel Variance Sources**: Potential contribution of new mutations, epigenetic variation, or previously undetected genetic architecture cannot be excluded (Hill, 2016) • **Sex-Limited Selection Validation**: Strong genetic correlation (0.82 ± 0.089) validated sex-limited selection strategy effectiveness demonstrating shared genetic architecture enables population-wide improvement • **Continued Selection Potential**: Findings support that continued genetic gain is achievable through optimized strategies even in highly inbred populations (Meuwissen et al., 2020)

### Methodological Contributions for Genomic Evaluation

• **Significant Advancement**: Refined deregression approach represents significant methodological advancement for genomic analysis in highly structured populations (Garrick et al., 2009) • **Reliability Improvement**: Dramatic reliability improvement (0.15 to 0.38) demonstrates critical importance of properly accounting for complex relationship structures and Mendelian sampling prediction error variance • **Technical Innovations**: Key improvements include accurate information content assessment and proper weighting of information from various sources while accounting for dependencies among relatives (Henderson, 1984) • **Breeding Value Accuracy**: Appropriate reliability estimation incorporating Mendelian sampling PEV provides realistic breeding value accuracy estimates in highly inbred populations • **GWAS Enhancement**: Enhanced genomic analysis through more accurate pseudo-phenotypes improves GWAS power and reduces false discovery rates leading to better identification of causal variants (Hong and Park, 2012) • **Broad Applicability**: Methodological advances particularly relevant for livestock breeding programs working with closed populations, endangered breeds, or species with extensive relationship matrices (VanRaden, 2008) • **Traditional Method Limitations**: Traditional approaches may provide misleading results where complex pedigree structures and high inbreeding levels exist (Garrick et al., 2009) • **Computational Considerations**: Methods enable more efficient computation of prediction error variances in complex population structures

### Population Management and Breeding Strategy Implications

• **Sustainable Selection**: Long-term selection sustainability suggests genetic progress can continue far longer than traditionally expected even in highly inbred populations (Hill, 2016) • **Overcoming Plateaus**: Findings indicate apparent selection plateaus may be overcome through improved breeding system design rather than reaching absolute genetic limits (Weber and Diggins, 1990) • **Selection Intensity Maintenance**: Persistence of genetic variance suggests selection intensity can be maintained longer than typically assumed provided breeding strategies maintain Mendelian sampling variance (Falconer and Mackay, 1996) • **Reproductive Performance Monitoring**: While extreme inbreeding levels may be tolerable in some contexts, monitoring reproductive performance remains important for population viability • **Diversity Preservation**: Balancing genetic gain with diversity preservation remains crucial for long-term sustainability despite apparent tolerance to high inbreeding (Lynch and Walsh, 1998) • **Livestock Applications**: Direct relevance for livestock breeding programs facing similar challenges in closed populations with limited genetic diversity • **Breeding Strategy Optimization**: Closed population management can potentially achieve continued genetic progress through optimized breeding strategies that maximize Mendelian sampling variance (Meuwissen et al., 2020) • **Economic Implications**: Results have important implications for breeding program design where maintaining genetic variance is critical for sustained improvement and economic viability (Hill, 2016) • **Future Research Directions**: Findings suggest need for research into mechanisms maintaining genetic variance under extreme selection to optimize breeding strategies
