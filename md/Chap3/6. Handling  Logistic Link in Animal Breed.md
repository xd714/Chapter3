### Handling Data with a Logistic Link in Animal Breeding Models

When conception rate or similar binary traits (e.g., conceived/not conceived) are modeled using a logistic link function, the data requires specific treatment and modeling considerations due to its binary nature and the nonlinear link between predictors and response. Here is how you typically deal with such data:

#### 1. Nature of the Data

- The response variable is binary (0 or 1), representing failure or success (e.g., not conceived vs. conceived).
- The logistic link function models the probability \$ p \$ of success on a logistic scale:

$$
\text{logit}(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \eta = Xb + Za + Wp + e
$$

where \$ \eta \$ is the linear predictor including fixed effects $Xb$, random additive genetic effects $Za$, permanent environment effects $Wp$, and residual $e$.


#### 2. Model Specification and Estimation

- **Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs)** are used, incorporating the logistic link function to handle the binary trait.
- Fixed effects might include environmental and management factors such as herd, parity, season, technician, and time between heat and AI.
- Random effects incorporate additive genetic effects (animal model), permanent environment effects, and possibly maternal or inbreeding effects.
- Estimation is typically performed by methods like Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) adapted for GLMMs or Bayesian approaches (e.g., Gibbs sampling).
- Specialized software for animal breeding and mixed models (e.g., ASReml, BLUPF90, SAS GLIMMIX) supports logistic link and variance component estimation.


#### 3. Data Preparation

- Encode the binary outcomes properly (0 for failure, 1 for success).
- Include all relevant fixed effects based on biological knowledge and data structure.
- Pedigree or genomic relationship matrices are included for random genetic effects to estimate breeding values.
- Since logistic models work with probabilities, ensure balanced or near-balanced data where possible (ratio of ones to zeros close to 50%) to achieve stable estimates, though imbalance can be handled with appropriate techniques.


#### 4. Interpretation

- Model outputs are on the logit (log-odds) scale; converting to probabilities is done via the inverse logit transformation:

$$
p = \frac{e^\eta}{1 + e^\eta}
$$
- Heritability and variance components are interpreted on the underlying liability (logit) scale.
- Residual variance on the logistic scale is fixed to $\pi^2 / 3 \approx 3.29$ to standardize variance for the binomial response.
- Heritability is computed considering this fixed residual variance.


#### 5. Dealing with Results

- Predict breeding values for fertility as underlying liabilities.
- Use model predictions for selection decisions.
- Evaluate model fit via classification accuracy, likelihood measures, and correlations between estimated breeding values and observed outcomes.
- Consider additional model checks for convergence, overdispersion, and goodness-of-fit.


#### Summary

To deal with binary conception rate data in the presence of a logistic link:

- Use a generalized linear mixed model framework.
- Specify fixed and random effects carefully.
- Encode data as binary outcomes.
- Interpret results on the underlying logit liability scale.
- Use appropriate software/tools designed for logistic mixed models in animal breeding.

This approach robustly models conception rates incorporating genetic and environmental factors, providing heritability estimates and breeding values for fertility even though the trait is binary and non-normally distributed[^1][^2][^3][^4].
