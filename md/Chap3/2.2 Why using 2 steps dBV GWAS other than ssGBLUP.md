## Bottom Line

| Approach            | Best For                                                  | DU6 Study                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **ssGBLUP**         | Production breeding, maximum accuracy, routine evaluation | ❌ **Wrong fit** - prevents research objectives |
| **2-Step dBV GWAS** | Research, discovery, method development, education        | ✅ **Perfect choice** - matches all objectives  |

## Example workflow:
 1. Run ssGBLUP (exclude chromosome being tested)
2. Use breeding values as phenotypes in GWAS
3. Include genomic relationship matrix as covariate
GWAS could be **more powerful** than the deregression approach, especially if you implement leave-one-chromosome-out validation.



#### **Deregressed proofs handle these better:**

```
Missing data in ssGBLUP:
→ Requires imputation or deletion
→ Affects entire analysis

Missing data with deregressed proofs:
→ Just use animals with reliable EBVs
→ Simpler to handle
```

### **4. Computational Considerations**

**Matrix inversion complexity:**

```
ssGBLUP: Invert H matrix (size = all animals)
- 50K animals → 50K × 50K matrix inversion
- Memory: ~10GB just for the matrix
- Time: hours to days

Deregressed proofs: Standard GWAS
- Only genotyped animals (maybe 5K-10K)
- Memory: ~100MB  
- Time: minutes
```

### **5. Validation and Trust**

**Conservative scientific approach:**

```
Established method (deregressed proofs):
✓ Well-understood statistical properties
✓ Extensively validated in literature
✓ Reviewers/regulators comfortable with it
✓ Reproducible results across labs

New method (ssGBLUP):
? Fewer validation studies
? Potential for implementation errors
? Less reviewer familiarity
? Method still evolving
```

### **6. Specific DU6 Data Characteristics**

Without knowing your specific dataset, common reasons include:

#### **Dairy industry patterns:**

- **Multi-country data** - different pedigree systems hard to integrate
- **Historical data** - older records may lack proper pedigree links
- **Breeding company data** - proprietary information sharing limits
- **Trait definitions** - standardization across populations difficult

#### **Genotyping patterns:**

- **Selected genotyping** - only elite animals genotyped (creates bias)
- **Different chip versions** - SNP panels changed over time
- **Population structure** - multiple breeds/lines in dataset

## **When Deregressed Proofs Might Actually Be Better**

### **1. Highly Selected Populations**

```
Problem: If only elite animals are genotyped
ssGBLUP: Biased estimates (missing genetic diversity)
Deregressed proofs: Accounts for selection through EBV reliability weights
```

### **2. Complex Trait Models**

```
Multi-trait, maternal effects, random regression models:
ssGBLUP: Requires complex implementation
Deregressed proofs: Uses existing sophisticated BLUP models
```

### **3. Cross-Population Analysis**

```
Combining multiple breeds/populations:
ssGBLUP: Relationship matrices incompatible
Deregressed proofs: Each population analyzed separately, then combined
```

## **What This Means for Your Analysis**

### **Questions to ask about your DU6 data:**

1. **Data completeness:**
    - Do you have complete pedigrees?
    - Are phenotypes available for most animals?
    - How many generations of data?
2. **Population structure:**
    - Single breed or multiple?
    - Any obvious population stratification?
    - Selection pressure over time?
3. **Computational resources:**
    - How many animals total?
    - Available computing power?
    - Timeline constraints?
4. **Analysis goals:**
    - GWAS discovery vs. genomic prediction?
    - Publication requirements?
    - Regulatory approval needed?

### **Practical recommendation:**

If you're getting good results with deregressed proofs and your analysis goals are met, **it may not be worth switching**. The theoretical advantage of ssGBLUP only translates to practical advantage when:

1. You have high-quality, complete datasets
2. Computational resources are adequate
3. Implementation is done correctly
4. The specific genetic architecture benefits from the method

### **The "Good Enough" Principle**

Sometimes in science, **"good enough"** trumps **"theoretically optimal"**:

```
Deregressed proofs might give you:
- 85% of the theoretical maximum accuracy
- 100% reliability in implementation
- 10% of the computational cost
- 50% of the development time

ssGBLUP might give you:
- 100% of the theoretical maximum accuracy  
- 80% chance of correct implementation
- 1000% of the computational cost
- 500% of the development time
```

ssGBLUP would essentially be **fitting the same relationship information twice** (pedigree + genomic), while DRP cleanly separates **family structure** from **individual genomic effects**. Since your research specifically asks "what maintains genetic variance despite extreme inbreeding," you need the clean individual genetic signal that only DRP can provide.

The choice of DRP over ssGBLUP is not just appropriate - it's **scientifically necessary** for your research objectives.

## 1. **Population Structure Challenges**

Your DU6 line has extreme characteristics that make ssGBLUP problematic:

- **Extremely high inbreeding** (F > 0.78 in recent generations)
- **Single family structure** after bottleneck
- **200+ generations of intense selection**
- **Severe bottleneck during facility transfer**

The DU6 mouse line had been selected for high body weight in males for more than 150 generations, when the line was transferred to a new mouse facility under SPF condition. Up to this time point selection was done as family selection by a simple index. After the line had been reestablished in the new environment -- undergoing a severe bottleneck -- further selection relied on BLUP-EBVs combined with effort to limit the further loss of heterozygosity by applying OCS.

## 2. **Avoiding Double-Counting Information**

In your highly structured population, ssGBLUP would create **severe double-counting** problems:

- **Same individuals** used for both pedigree relationships and genomic relationships
- **Limited genetic diversity** means genomic and pedigree relationships are highly correlated
- **Single-step combines** both information sources, but in your case they largely represent the **same underlying relationships**

Your methodology documents recognize this: The approach has been updated to address practical challenges encountered in previous analyses and incorporates improved methods for deregressed proofs calculation using Mendelian sampling prediction error variance.

## 3. **Pure Genomic Signal Needed**

Since you want to identify **specific QTL** that explain persistent genetic variance despite extreme inbreeding, you need:

- **Clean separation** between family effects and individual genomic effects
- **Individual-specific genetic merit** free from ancestral contributions
- **Unbiased SNP effect estimates** not confounded by population structure
