# my mice conception rate, in group is 0.6, the trait as binomial heritabitliy is 0.1841, what other conception rate usually are

Your mouse conception rate at 0.6 (60%) and binomial heritability of 0.1841 can be compared to typical values reported in the scientific literature:

- Mouse fertility or conception rates vary depending on strain, age, and conditions, but conception rates around 60–80% are common under laboratory conditions for many strains such as C57BL/6[^3][^7].
- One study reports average fertilization for wild-type C57BL/6 mice at about 80%[^3].
- Another source indicates pregnancy rates ranging from roughly 39% up to 69% depending on timing and strain[^7].
- Heritability estimates for reproductive traits like conception rate or fertility index in mice tend to be low to moderate, ranging from approximately 0.1 to 0.2, similar to your value of 0.1841[^11].
- Environmental and management factors play a strong role in fertility variation which explains moderate conception rates and relatively low heritability.

In summary, your conception rate of 0.6 is plausible though somewhat on the lower side of the typical range in standard mouse strains. Your heritability estimate of ~0.18 is within the expected range for binomial fertility traits in mice reported in research studies.
