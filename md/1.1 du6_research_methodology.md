2. Identify genomic regions contributing to persistent genetic variation
3. Assess the impact of bottleneck and OCS implementation on genetic diversity
4. Investigate the relationship between inbreeding and fertility decline

---

## Phase 1: Quantitative Genetic Analysis

### Step 1.1: Genetic Variance Estimation
**Objective**: Track changes in additive genetic variance across generations

**Why Do This?**
- Provides baseline evidence of whether genetic variance has been depleted or maintained despite 150+ generations of selection
- Distinguishes between true genetic variance vs. residual variance inflated by model misspecification
- Critical for understanding if continued selection is feasible or if the population has reached a selection plateau

**How to Do It**:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Extract BM42 records from generation 150-200 (post-bottleneck period)
   - Include all available covariates: sex, litter size, dam age, generation, contemporary group
   - Remove outliers (>3 SD from mean) and animals with incomplete records

2. **Sliding Window REML Analysis**:
   ```
   # Use ASReml-R or similar software
   # 10-generation windows with 5-generation overlap
   for(gen_start in seq(150, 190, 5)){
     subset_data <- filter(data, generation >= gen_start & generation < gen_start+10)
     model <- asreml(BM42 ~ sex + litter_size + generation, 
                     random = ~ped(animal), data = subset_data)
     extract_variance_components(model)
   }
   ```

3. **Variance Partitioning Using Genomic Data**:
   - Build genomic relationship matrix (G) using SNP data
   - Partition variance into genic (σ²ₐ_genic) and LD components (σ²ₐ_LD)
   ```
   # GBLUP model
   BM42 ~ μ + fixed_effects + g + ε
   # where g ~ N(0, G*σ²ₐ)
   ```

### Step 1.2: Inbreeding Assessment
**Why Do This?**
- Validates the expected high inbreeding levels from pedigree analysis
- Identifies discrepancies between pedigree and genomic inbreeding that might indicate population substructure
- Provides accurate estimates of heterozygosity loss for variance calculations

**How to Do It**:
1. **Pedigree-Based Inbreeding (F_ped)**:
   ```
   # Use PEDIG or similar software
   # Calculate Wright's inbreeding coefficient
   F_ped = 1 - (1/2)^(n-1) * Σ(path_contributions)
   ```

2. **Genomic Inbreeding Estimation**:
   - **ROH-based inbreeding (F_ROH)**:
     ```
     # Use PLINK --homozyg command
     # Parameters: --homozyg-window-snp 50 --homozyg-snp 0.05 --homozyg-kb 1000
     F_ROH = Σ(ROH_length) / autosomal_genome_length
     ```
   
   - **Excess homozygosity (F_HOM)**:
     ```
     F_HOM = (O_HOM - E_HOM) / (N_SNPs - E_HOM)
     # where O_HOM = observed homozygotes, E_HOM = expected under HWE
     ```

3. **Comparison and Validation**:
   - Plot F_ped vs F_ROH to identify outliers
   - Investigate animals with |F_ped - F_ROH| > 0.1 for pedigree errors
   - Calculate correlation between estimates (should be >0.8 for accurate pedigree)

---

## Phase 2: Bottleneck Impact Assessment

### Step 2.1: Pre/Post Transfer Analysis
**Objective**: Quantify genetic diversity loss during facility transfer

**Why Do This?**
- The facility transfer created a severe bottleneck that likely caused significant allele frequency changes
- Understanding bottleneck severity helps explain current genetic architecture and informs future breeding decisions
- Identifies which genomic regions were most affected by drift vs. selection

**How to Do It**:
1. **Allele Frequency Spectrum Analysis**:
   ```
   # Compare generations 145-150 (pre-transfer) vs 155-160 (post-transfer)
   # Use VCFtools or similar
   for each_SNP:
     AF_pre = calculate_allele_freq(gen_145_150)
     AF_post = calculate_allele_freq(gen_155_160)
     delta_AF = abs(AF_post - AF_pre)
     
   # Plot delta_AF distribution
   # Identify SNPs with delta_AF > 0.2 (severe drift)
   ```

2. **Founder Genome Equivalents (fge)**:
   ```
   # Calculate before and after bottleneck
   fge = 1 / Σ(p_i²)
   # where p_i = proportional contribution of founder i
   
   # Track founder representation across generations
   # Use pedigree analysis to trace founder contributions
   ```

3. **Linkage Disequilibrium Decay Analysis**:
   ```
   # Calculate r² between SNP pairs at different distances
   # Use PLINK --r2 --ld-window-kb 1000
   # Compare LD patterns pre/post bottleneck
   # Higher LD post-bottleneck indicates population structure changes
   ```

### Step 2.2: Selection Response Modeling
**Why Do This?**
- Determines whether the change in selection method (family selection → BLUP+OCS) was effective
- Quantifies genetic gain attributable to selection vs. environmental effects
- Provides evidence for continued genetic variance availability

**How to Do It**:
1. **Genetic Gain Calculation**:
   ```
   # Pre-transfer (generations 120-150): Family selection
   ΔG_pre = (mean_BM42_gen150 - mean_BM42_gen120) / 30
   
   # Post-transfer (generations 155-200): BLUP+OCS  
   ΔG_post = (mean_BM42_gen200 - mean_BM42_gen155) / 45
   
   # Compare realized vs predicted genetic gain
   ΔG_predicted = h²σₚ × i × (1/L)
   ```

2. **Selection Intensity Comparison**:
   ```
   # Calculate selection intensity (i) for each period
   # Family selection period: i = f(proportion_selected_families)
   # BLUP+OCS period: i = f(truncation_point_EBVs)
   
   # Account for sex-limited selection (males only)
   i_effective = i_males * (proportion_males_breeding)
   ```

3. **Environmental Trend Analysis**:
   ```
   # Separate genetic from environmental trends
   # Use mixed model with generation as fixed effect
   BM42 ~ generation + sex + animal + ε
   # Coefficient of 'generation' = environmental trend
   ```

## Phase 3: Genomic Analysis - Two-Step GWAS Approach

### Step 3.1: De-regressed EBV Calculation
**Objective**: Prepare unbiased phenotypes for GWAS analysis

**Why Do This?**
- Direct use of EBVs in GWAS creates double-counting bias because EBVs already incorporate family information
- Deregressed EBVs (DEBV) remove parental/ancestral contributions, providing individual-specific genetic signals
- Essential in highly structured populations like DU6 where family relationships dominate the data structure
- Improves power to detect segregating QTLs by reducing the influence of family mean effects

**How to Do It**:
1. **Calculate BLUP-EBVs**:
   ```
   # Use all available BM42 data (generations 150-200)
   # Mixed model with pedigree-based relationship matrix (A)
   model <- asreml(BM42 ~ sex + generation + litter_size,
                   random = ~ped(animal),
                   data = complete_dataset)
   EBVs <- predict(model, classify="animal")$pvals
   ```

2. **Deregression Process**:
   ```
   # For each animal i with genotypes:
   # Calculate parent average (PA)
   PA_i = 0.5 * (EBV_sire + EBV_dam)
   
   # Calculate reliability of EBV
   PEV_i = prediction_error_variance[i]
   rel_i = 1 - (PEV_i / σ²ₐ)
   
   # Deregress EBV
   DEBV_i = (EBV_i - PA_i) / rel_i
   
   # Calculate weights for GWAS
   weight_i = rel_i / (1 - rel_i)
   ```

3. **Quality Control of DEBVs**:
   ```
   # Check DEBV distribution
   # Should be approximately normal with mean ≈ 0
   # Remove extreme outliers (>4 SD from mean)
   # Verify that DEBV variance > EBV variance (deregression successful)
   ```

### Step 3.2: Genome-Wide Association Study
**Why Do This?**
- Identifies specific genomic regions contributing to remaining genetic variance for BM42
- Provides molecular evidence that genetic variance still exists despite high inbreeding
- Locates QTLs that could be targeted for future selection or introgression programs
- Tests whether variance is concentrated in few large-effect loci or many small-effect loci

**How to Do It**:
1. **SNP Quality Control**:
   ```
   # Given high inbreeding, use relaxed MAF threshold
   # Remove SNPs with:
   plink --bfile raw_snps \
         --maf 0.01 \           # Minor allele frequency > 1%
         --geno 0.1 \           # Genotyping rate > 90%  
         --hwe 1e-10 \          # Very relaxed HWE (expected deviation due to inbreeding)
         --make-bed --out qc_snps
   ```

2. **Population Structure Analysis**:
   ```
   # Principal Component Analysis
   plink --bfile qc_snps --pca 10 --out pca_results
   
   # Calculate genomic relationship matrix (G)
   # Use VanRaden method 1: G = (XX')/Σ2pᵢ(1-pᵢ)
   # where X = centered genotype matrix
   ```

3. **GWAS Mixed Linear Model**:
   ```
   # Use GCTA, EMMAX, or similar software
   # Model: DEBV_ijw = μ + SNP_i + PC1 + PC2 + PC3 + u_j + ε_ij
   # where u_j ~ N(0, G*σ²ᵤ) accounts for population structure
   
   gcta64 --bfile qc_snps \
          --pheno debv_phenotypes.txt \
          --qcovar pca_covariates.txt \
          --grm grm_matrix \
          --mlma \
          --out gwas_results
   ```

4. **Statistical Significance and Multiple Testing**:
   ```
   # Calculate genomic control lambda
   lambda = median(chi_square_statistics) / 0.456
   
   # Apply FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg)
   # or Bonferroni correction: α = 0.05/n_SNPs
   
   # Set significance thresholds:
   # Suggestive: 1/n_SNPs
   # Significant: 0.05/n_SNPs (Bonferroni)
   ```

5. **Results Interpretation**:
   ```
   # Create Manhattan plot and Q-Q plot
   # Identify lead SNPs (lowest p-value in each significant region)
   # Define QTL regions (±1 Mb around lead SNPs or LD-based boundaries)
   # Calculate proportion of genetic variance explained by significant SNPs
   
   # Variance explained = 2 * MAF * (1-MAF) * β² / σ²ₚ
   ```

## Phase 4: Mendelian Sampling Variance Analysis

### Step 4.1: Within-Family Variance Assessment
**Objective**: Quantify genetic variance available for selection within the remaining families

**Why Do This?**
- Even with one predominant family, Mendelian sampling creates genetic variation among siblings due to recombination
- This variance represents the "raw material" for continued selection and determines the selection limit
- Critical for understanding why genetic progress continues despite extreme inbreeding
- Quantifies the potential for producing superior offspring from current breeding animals

**How to Do It**:
1. **Pedigree-Based MS Variance Calculation**:
   ```
   # For each genotyped animal i:
   # Extract prediction error variance (PEV) from BLUP analysis
   PEV_i = diag(C22)  # where C22 is inverse of coefficient matrix
   
   # Calculate parental average PEV
   if(both_parents_known):
     PEV_parents = 0.5 * (PEV_sire + PEV_dam)
   else:
     PEV_parents = 0.25 * σ²ₐ  # unknown parent assumption
   
   # MS variance for animal i
   PEV_MS_i = PEV_i - PEV_parents
   
   # Population MS variance
   σ²_MS = mean(PEV_MS_i)
   ```

2. **Genomic MS Variance Estimation**:
   ```
   # Use phased genotypes (if available) or infer haplotypes
   # For each mating pair, simulate all possible offspring genotypes
   
   for(sire_hap in c(1,2)):
     for(dam_hap in c(1,2)):
       for(recombination_pattern in possible_patterns):
         offspring_genotype = create_offspring(sire_hap, dam_hap, recomb_pattern)
         GEBV_offspring = calculate_GEBV(offspring_genotype, SNP_effects)
   
   # MS variance = variance among all possible offspring GEBVs
   σ²_MS_genomic = var(all_possible_GEBVs)
   ```

3. **Selection Potential Assessment**:
   ```
   # Probability of producing offspring in top 10%
   # Given current parent EBVs and MS variance
   
   parent_average_EBV = 0.5 * (sire_EBV + dam_EBV)
   offspring_EBV_distribution = N(parent_average_EBV, σ²_MS)
   
   P(offspring > 90th_percentile) = 1 - pnorm(threshold_90th, 
                                              mean = parent_average_EBV,
                                              sd = sqrt(σ²_MS))
   ```

### Step 4.2: Mutation Load Analysis
**Why Do This?**
- New mutations could maintain genetic variance despite strong selection and inbreeding
- Identifies whether observed variance comes from segregating alleles or recent mutations
- Assesses mutation-selection balance in this extreme selection scenario

**How to Do It**:
1. **De Novo Mutation Detection** (if whole-genome sequence available):
   ```
   # Compare offspring sequences to parental sequences
   # Use GATK or similar pipeline for variant calling
   
   # Filter for true de novo mutations:
   # - Not present in either parent
   # - High sequencing depth (>20x) in all individuals
   # - Mendelian error pattern (heterozygous in offspring, homozygous reference in both parents)
   
   # Calculate mutation rate per generation
   μ = number_de_novo_mutations / (genome_size * number_offspring)
   ```

2. **Segregating Deleterious Variant Analysis**:
   ```
   # Annotate SNPs using Ensembl VEP or similar tool
   # Classify variants by predicted effect:
   # - Synonymous (neutral)
   # - Missense (potentially deleterious)
   # - Nonsense/frameshift (likely deleterious)
   
   # Calculate derived allele frequency spectrum
   # Test for excess of low-frequency deleterious variants
   
   # Tajima's D test for selection signatures
   ```

3. **Balancing Selection Detection**:
   ```
   # Look for signatures of balancing selection maintaining variance:
   # - High heterozygosity despite inbreeding (He > expected from F)
   # - Elevated Tajima's D values
   # - Long-range haplotype homozygosity (LRHH) analysis
   
   # Focus on QTL regions identified in GWAS
   # Test if QTL show different selection patterns than genome-wide average
   ```

## Phase 5: Fertility-Inbreeding Correlation Analysis

### Step 5.1: Reproductive Performance Modeling
**Objective**: Investigate the observed fertility decline

**Why Do This?**
- Fertility decline suggests inbreeding depression affecting fitness traits
- Understanding this relationship is crucial for breeding program sustainability
- Determines whether fertility problems are due to inbreeding, selection pressure, or environmental factors
- Guides decisions about incorporating fertility into the selection index

**How to Do It**:
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   ```
   # Collect fertility traits across generations 150-200:
   # - Litter size at birth (LSB)
   # - Litter size at weaning (LSW)  
   # - Number of parturitions per female
   # - Inter-litter interval (days)
   # - Conception rate (matings to conception)
   # - Age at first mating
   
   # Include environmental covariates:
   # - Season/month of mating
   # - Dam age at mating
   # - Parity number
   # - Body weight at mating
   ```

2. **Inbreeding Depression Analysis**:
   ```
   # Mixed linear model for each fertility trait
   fertility_trait ~ F_ped + F_ROH + generation + dam_age + 
                     parity + season + BM42_EBV + 
                     random(dam_ID) + random(sire_ID) + ε
   
   # Test different inbreeding measures:
   # Model 1: F_ped only
   # Model 2: F_ROH only  
   # Model 3: Both F_ped and F_ROH
   # Model 4: Recent vs ancient inbreeding (F_ROH by segment length)
   
   # Compare model fit using AIC/BIC
   ```

3. **Inbreeding-Fertility Regression**:
   ```
   # Calculate inbreeding depression per 1% increase in F
   # β_F = regression coefficient of fertility on inbreeding
   
   # Expected fertility decline:
   # ΔFertility = β_F × ΔF × 100
   
   # Test for non-linear relationships:
   fertility ~ F + F² + other_effects
   ```

4. **Selection-Fertility Trade-off Analysis**:
   ```
   # Genetic correlation between BM42 and fertility traits
   # Bivariate mixed model:
   cbind(BM42, fertility_trait) ~ trait + trait:sex + trait:generation +
                                  random(trait:animal) + residual
   
   # Calculate correlated response in fertility:
   # CR_fertility = h_fertility × h_BM42 × rG × i_BM42
   ```

### Step 5.2: Fitness Landscape Analysis
**Why Do This?**
- Quantifies the total fitness cost of continued selection for BM42
- Identifies critical inbreeding thresholds beyond which fertility collapses
- Provides framework for optimizing selection intensity vs. population viability

**How to Do It**:
1. **Fitness Index Construction**:
   ```
   # Combine fertility traits into composite fitness index
   # Weight by economic importance or biological significance
   
   Fitness_Index = w1×LSB + w2×LSW + w3×(1/inter_litter_interval) + 
                   w4×conception_rate + w5×reproductive_lifespan
   
   # Standardize weights so they sum to 1
   # Use principal component analysis if traits are highly correlated
   ```

2. **Critical Inbreeding Threshold**:
   ```
   # Fit segmented regression to identify breakpoints
   # Model: Fitness ~ threshold(F, change_point) + other_effects
   
   library(segmented)
   seg_model <- segmented(lm(Fitness ~ F_ROH + generation), 
                         seg.Z = ~F_ROH)
   
   # Extract change point and confidence intervals
   critical_F = seg_model$psi[,"Est."]
   ```

3. **Population Viability Analysis**:
   ```
   # Simulate population dynamics under different scenarios:
   # Scenario 1: Continue current selection intensity
   # Scenario 2: Reduce selection intensity by 50%  
   # Scenario 3: Include fertility in selection index
   
   for(generation in 1:50):
     # Update allele frequencies based on selection
     # Calculate expected inbreeding increase: ΔF = 1/(2Ne)
     # Predict fertility decline: ΔFertility = β_F × ΔF
     # Update population size based on fertility
     # Check for population extinction (fertility < replacement rate)
   ```

4. **Optimal Selection Strategy**:
   ```
   # Multi-objective optimization
   # Maximize: λ1×ΔG_BM42 + λ2×Fertility - λ3×ΔF
   # Subject to: Population_size > minimum_viable_size
   
   # Use genetic algorithm or similar optimization method
   # Test different weight combinations (λ1, λ2, λ3)
   ```

---

## Phase 6: Genomic Prediction Validation

### Step 6.1: Cross-Validation Analysis
**Objective**: Validate prediction accuracy in highly inbred population

**Why Do This?**
- Standard genomic prediction methods may perform poorly in highly inbred populations
- Validates whether remaining genetic variance is effectively captured by SNP markers
- Informs decisions about marker density and prediction models for future selection
- Tests whether low-frequency variants (MAF < 0.05) contribute significant prediction accuracy

**How to Do It**:
1. **Cross-Validation Design**:
   ```
   # Given limited population size, use:
   # - 5-fold cross-validation (80% training, 20% validation)
   # - Leave-one-generation-out (LOGO) validation
   # - Random sampling cross-validation
   
   # Ensure validation sets maintain family structure
   # Avoid splitting full-sibs between training and validation
   
   set.seed(12345)
   families <- unique(data$family_id)
   fold_assignments <- sample(rep(1:5, length.out = length(families)))
   ```

2. **Prediction Model Comparison**:
   ```
   # Compare multiple models:
   # Model 1: BLUP (pedigree-based)
   EBV_BLUP <- predict_BLUP(phenotypes, pedigree_A_matrix)
   
   # Model 2: GBLUP (all SNPs)
   EBV_GBLUP <- predict_GBLUP(phenotypes, genomic_G_matrix)
   
   # Model 3: GBLUP (MAF > 0.05 only)
   EBV_GBLUP_common <- predict_GBLUP(phenotypes, G_matrix_common_SNPs)
   
   # Model 4: Single-step GBLUP (combines pedigree and genomic)
   EBV_ssGBLUP <- predict_ssGBLUP(phenotypes, H_matrix)
   
   # Model 5: BayesR (variable selection)
   EBV_BayesR <- predict_BayesR(phenotypes, genotypes)
   ```

3. **Accuracy Assessment**:
   ```
   # Calculate prediction accuracy for each fold
   for(fold in 1:5):
     validation_animals <- families[fold_assignments == fold]
     training_animals <- families[fold_assignments != fold]
     
     # Fit model on training set
     model <- fit_prediction_model(training_data)
     
     # Predict validation set
     predictions <- predict(model, validation_data)
     
     # Calculate accuracy
     accuracy[fold] <- cor(predictions, validation_phenotypes) / sqrt(heritability)
   
   # Overall accuracy = mean(accuracy)
   # Bias = mean(predictions) - mean(observations)
   ```

4. **Variant Frequency Analysis**:
   ```
   # Test contribution of different MAF classes
   MAF_classes <- list(
     "rare" = SNPs[MAF < 0.01],
     "low_freq" = SNPs[MAF >= 0.01 & MAF < 0.05], 
     "common" = SNPs[MAF >= 0.05]
   )
   
   # Sequential inclusion analysis
   accuracy_cumulative <- c()
   for(class in names(MAF_classes)):
     SNPs_included <- c(SNPs_included, MAF_classes[[class]])
     G_matrix_subset <- calculate_G_matrix(SNPs_included)
     accuracy_cumulative[class] <- cross_validate(G_matrix_subset)
   ```

### Step 6.2: Optimal Contribution Selection Evaluation
**Objective**: Assess OCS effectiveness and optimize future breeding decisions

**Why Do This?**
- Determines whether OCS successfully balanced genetic gain with diversity maintenance
- Identifies optimal constraint levels for future breeding decisions
- Provides framework for incorporating genomic information into OCS
- Tests whether current OCS parameters are appropriate for the population's genetic architecture

**How to Do It**:
1. **Historical OCS Performance**:
   ```
   # Compare realized vs expected outcomes (generations 155-200)
   # Extract actual breeding contributions from pedigree
   
   for(generation in 155:200):
     # Actual genetic gain
     realized_gain[gen] <- mean(BM42[generation]) - mean(BM42[generation-1])
     
     # Predicted gain from OCS optimization
     predicted_gain[gen] <- sum(parent_contributions * parent_EBVs) - population_mean
     
     # Actual vs expected inbreeding increase
     realized_delta_F[gen] <- F_ped[generation] - F_ped[generation-1]
     predicted_delta_F[gen] <- calculate_expected_deltaF(parent_contributions, A_matrix)
   
   # Performance metrics
   gain_efficiency = cor(realized_gain, predicted_gain)
   inbreeding_control = abs(mean(realized_delta_F) - mean(predicted_delta_F))
   ```

2. **Diversity Metrics Assessment**:
   ```
   # Calculate Gini coefficient for breeding contributions
   # Gini = 0 (equal contributions), Gini = 1 (single parent used)
   
   calculate_gini <- function(contributions) {
     sorted_contrib <- sort(contributions)
     n <- length(sorted_contrib)
     index <- 1:n
     gini <- (2 * sum(index * sorted_contrib)) / (n * sum(sorted_contrib)) - (n + 1) / n
     return(gini)
   }
   
   # Track across generations
   for(gen in 155:200):
     parent_contributions <- extract_contributions(gen)
     gini_coefficient[gen] <- calculate_gini(parent_contributions)
   
   # Founder genome equivalents over time
   fge[gen] <- 1 / sum(founder_proportions[gen]^2)
   ```

3. **Genomic OCS Optimization**:
   ```
   # Replace pedigree-based relationships with genomic relationships
   # Solve optimization problem:
   # Maximize: c'μ (genetic merit)
   # Subject to: c'Gc ≤ ΔF_max (inbreeding constraint)
   #            Σc = 1 (contribution constraint)
   #            c ≥ 0 (non-negativity)
   
   library(quadprog)
   
   # Set up quadratic programming problem
   D_matrix <- 2 * G_matrix  # Genomic relationship matrix
   d_vector <- rep(0, n_candidates)
   A_matrix <- rbind(rep(1, n_candidates),  # sum constraint
                     diag(n_candidates))     # non-negativity
   b_vector <- c(1, rep(0, n_candidates))
   
   # Add inbreeding constraint
   optimal_contributions <- solve.QP(D_matrix, d_vector, A_matrix, b_vector)
   ```

4. **Scenario Analysis for Future Breeding**:
   ```
   # Test different constraint levels
   delta_F_scenarios <- c(0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02)  # per generation
   
   for(constraint in delta_F_scenarios):
     # Optimize contributions under constraint
     contributions <- optimize_OCS(EBVs, G_matrix, constraint)
     
     # Predict outcomes
     predicted_gain[constraint] <- sum(contributions * EBVs)
     predicted_diversity[constraint] <- calculate_diversity_metrics(contributions)
     
     # Long-term simulation (20 generations)
     simulation_results[constraint] <- simulate_breeding_program(
       initial_population, contributions, n_generations = 20
     )
   
   # Identify optimal constraint level
   # Balance genetic gain and diversity maintenance
   optimal_constraint <- find_pareto_optimal(predicted_gain, predicted_diversity)
   ```

5. **Multi-trait OCS Implementation**:
   ```
   # Include fertility in selection objective
   # Economic weights: w_BM42 = 1.0, w_fertility = 0.3 (example)
   
   # Combined breeding objective
   selection_index <- w_BM42 * EBV_BM42 + w_fertility * EBV_fertility
   
   # Multi-trait genomic relationship matrix
   # Account for genetic correlations between traits
   G_multi <- kronecker(genetic_correlation_matrix, G_matrix)
   
   # Optimize contributions for multi-trait objective
   optimal_contributions_multi <- optimize_multi_trait_OCS(
     selection_index, G_multi, delta_F_constraint
   )
   ```

## Enhanced Methodological Suggestions

### 1. **Haplotype-Based Analysis**
**Why Enhanced Approach Needed?**
- Single-SNP GWAS may miss important haplotype effects in highly inbred populations
- Haplotype blocks provide better representation of ancestral chromosome segments
- More power to detect rare variants through linkage with common markers

**How to Implement**:
```
# Phase haplotypes using Beagle or similar software
java -jar beagle.jar gt=genotypes.vcf out=phased_haplotypes

# Haplotype-based GWAS
# Use sliding windows of 5-10 SNPs
for(window_start in seq(1, n_SNPs, 5)):
  window_SNPs <- SNPs[window_start:(window_start+9)]
  haplotypes <- extract_haplotypes(window_SNPs, phased_data)
  
  # Test haplotype associations
  model <- lm(DEBV ~ haplotype + PC1 + PC2 + PC3, weights = DEBV_weights)
  haplotype_effects[window_start] <- extract_effects(model)

# Identity-by-descent mapping
ibd_segments <- detect_IBD_segments(phased_haplotypes, min_length = 1cM)
test_IBD_associations(DEBV, ibd_segments)
```

### 2. **Functional Annotation**
**Why Do This?**
- Prioritizes candidate genes and variants for follow-up studies
- Provides biological context for GWAS findings
- Identifies regulatory elements that may have large effects despite low MAF

**How to Implement**:
```
# Annotate significant SNPs using Ensembl VEP
vep --input_file significant_SNPs.vcf \
    --output_file annotated_SNPs.txt \
    --species mus_musculus \
    --everything

# Gene set enrichment analysis
library(topGO)
significant_genes <- extract_genes_near_SNPs(significant_SNPs, window = 50000)
GO_enrichment <- runGO_analysis(significant_genes, mouse_genome_annotation)

# Regulatory element analysis
# Overlap SNPs with mouse ENCODE data
regulatory_overlap <- find_overlap(significant_SNPs, mouse_ENCODE_features)

# Protein-coding vs non-coding variant analysis
coding_SNPs <- filter(annotated_SNPs, consequence %in% c("missense", "nonsense", "synonymous"))
noncoding_SNPs <- filter(annotated_SNPs, !consequence %in% c("missense", "nonsense", "synonymous"))

# Compare effect sizes between variant classes
effect_size_comparison <- compare_distributions(coding_SNPs$beta, noncoding_SNPs$beta)
```

### 3. **Advanced Variance Modeling**
**Why Enhanced Models Needed?**
- Standard models assume constant variance across generations
- Environmental changes during facility transfer may create GxE interactions
- Epistatic interactions may maintain variance despite inbreeding

**How to Implement**:
```
# Reaction norm model for facility transfer effect
BM42 ~ EBV + facility_environment + EBV:facility_environment + other_effects

# Temporal variance model
# Allow variance components to change over generations
library(MCMCglmm)

# Heterogeneous variance model
prior <- list(
  R = list(V = diag(n_generations), nu = 0.002),
  G = list(G1 = list(V = diag(1), nu = 0.002))
)

temporal_model <- MCMCglmm(
  BM42 ~ generation + sex,
  random = ~animal,
  rcov = ~us(generation):units,  # Different residual variance per generation
  data = data,
  prior = prior
)

# Epistatic variance component
# Test for two-locus interactions among significant SNPs
significant_pairs <- combn(significant_SNPs, 2)

for(pair in 1:ncol(significant_pairs)):
  SNP1 <- significant_pairs[1, pair]
  SNP2 <- significant_pairs[2, pair]
  
  epistasis_model <- lm(DEBV ~ SNP1 + SNP2 + SNP1:SNP2 + covariates)
  epistasis_effects[pair] <- extract_interaction_effect(epistasis_model)
```

### 4. **Integrated Selection Strategy**
**Why Integration Needed?**
- Current single-trait selection for BM42 has led to fertility problems
- Need to balance multiple objectives for sustainable breeding program
- Genomic information can improve selection accuracy and diversity management

**How to Implement**:
```
# Multi-trait genomic selection index
# Include BM42, fertility, and possibly other fitness traits

# Calculate economic weights
economic_weights <- list(
  BM42 = 1.0,          # Arbitrary reference
  litter_size = 0.3,   # Based on economic analysis
  conception_rate = 0.2,
  reproductive_lifespan = 0.1
)

# Multi-trait BLUP
library(BGLR)

# Set up trait matrix
Y <- cbind(BM42, litter_size, conception_rate, reproductive_lifespan)

# Multi-trait genomic model
mt_model <- Multitrait(
  y = Y,
  ETA = list(
    Genomic = list(X = genotype_matrix, model = "BRR"),
    Pedigree = list(K = A_matrix, model = "RKHS")
  )
)

# Calculate selection index values
selection_index <- Y %*% economic_weights

# Optimize breeding decisions
final_OCS <- optimize_multi_trait_OCS(
  selection_index = selection_index,
  G_matrix = G_matrix,
  delta_F_constraint = 0.01,  # 1% per generation
  generation_interval = 0.5   # 6 months in mice
)
```
