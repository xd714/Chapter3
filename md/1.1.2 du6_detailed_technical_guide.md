# DU6 Research: Detailed Technical Implementation Guide

## Phase 1: Quantitative Genetic Analysis - Technical Implementation

### Step 1.1: Data Preparation and Quality Control

**Objective:** Prepare clean, standardized datasets for genetic analysis

**Technical Steps:**

**1.1.1 Phenotype Data Validation**
- **Outlier Detection:** Remove records where |BM42 - μ| > 6σ
- **Missing Value Assessment:** Calculate missing data percentage per variable
- **Temporal Trends:** Plot BM42 means by generation to identify environmental shifts
- **Distribution Normality:** Apply Shapiro-Wilk test; use Box-Cox transformation if λ ≠ 1

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
Outlier threshold: |yᵢ - ȳ| > k × σᵧ where k = 6
Box-Cox transformation: y'ᵢ = (yᵢ^λ - 1)/λ for λ ≠ 0
                             = ln(yᵢ) for λ = 0
```

**1.1.2 Pedigree Validation**
- **Completeness Check:** Calculate proportion of known parents per generation
- **Chronological Validation:** Ensure parent birth_date < offspring birth_date
- **Inbreeding Coefficient Bounds:** Verify 0 ≤ F ≤ 1 for all animals
- **Generation Assignment:** Use Fₚₑᵈ to validate generation numbering

**Key Validation Rules:**
```
Parent-offspring age difference ≥ minimum breeding age
Maximum number of offspring per parent ≤ biological limit
Sex consistency: sires are male, dams are female
```

**1.1.3 Contemporary Group Formation**
- **Primary Grouping:** Generation × Sex × Facility Period
- **Group Size Validation:** Minimum 5 animals per group
- **Connectedness Assessment:** Ensure genetic links between groups via common sires

**Contemporary Group Criteria:**
```
Same generation (±1 generation for small groups)
Same sex
Same facility period (pre/during/post transfer)
Adequate representation (n ≥ 5)
```

### Step 1.2: Temporal Variance Component Analysis

**Objective:** Track genetic variance changes across breeding periods

**1.2.1 Sliding Window REML Analysis**

**Technical Parameters:**
- **Window Size:** 15 generations (ensures stable estimates)
- **Overlap:** 10 generations (provides smooth transitions)
- **Analysis Periods:** Pre-bottleneck (gen 120-150), Bottleneck (151-155), Post-bottleneck (156-200)

**Mixed Model Framework:**
```
yᵢⱼₖₗ = μ + sexᵢ + generationⱼ + facility_periodₖ + litter_sizeₗ + aᵢ + lᵢ + eᵢⱼₖₗ

Where:
- aᵢ ~ N(0, A⊗σ²ₐ) [additive genetic effect]
- lᵢ ~ N(0, I⊗σ²ₗ) [common litter effect]  
- eᵢⱼₖₗ ~ N(0, I⊗σ²ₑ) [residual error]

Variance Components:
σ²ₚ = σ²ₐ + σ²ₗ + σ²ₑ
h² = σ²ₐ/σ²ₚ
```

**1.2.2 Convergence and Reliability Assessment**

**REML Convergence Criteria:**
- **Log-likelihood change:** ΔLL < 10⁻⁶ between iterations
- **Parameter change:** |θᵢ⁽ᵗ⁺¹⁾ - θᵢ⁽ᵗ⁾| < 10⁻⁴ for all variance components
- **Gradient norm:** ||∇LL|| < 10⁻³

**Reliability Indicators:**
```
Standard Error Ratio: SE(σ²ₐ)/σ²ₐ < 0.5 for reliable estimates
Likelihood Ratio Test: -2(LL₀ - LL₁) ~ χ² for model comparison
Information Criteria: AIC = -2LL + 2k, BIC = -2LL + k×ln(n)
```

### Step 1.3: Inbreeding Assessment

**Objective:** Calculate and validate multiple inbreeding measures

**1.3.1 Pedigree-Based Inbreeding (Fₚₑᵈ)**

**Wright's Method:**
```
Fₓ = ∑ᵢ [(1/2)ⁿⁱ⁺¹ × (1 + Fₐᵢ)]

Where:
- nᵢ = number of generations from X to common ancestor A through path i
- Fₐᵢ = inbreeding coefficient of common ancestor A
- Sum over all paths connecting parents of X
```

**Recursive Algorithm:**
```
F(offspring) = 0.5 × CoA(sire, dam)
CoA(i,j) = 0.5 × [CoA(sire_i, j) + CoA(dam_i, j)] × (1 + F_i)
```

**1.3.2 Genomic Inbreeding Measures**

**ROH-Based Inbreeding (F_ROH):**

**Detection Parameters:**
- **Minimum SNP density:** 1 SNP per 50kb
- **Window size:** 50 SNPs
- **Heterozygote threshold:** ≤5% of SNPs in window
- **Minimum ROH length:** 1 Mb (recent inbreeding), 0.5 Mb (ancient inbreeding)

**Calculation:**
```
F_ROH = ∑(L_ROH) / L_auto

Where:
- L_ROH = length of all ROH segments ≥ threshold
- L_auto = total autosomal genome length
```

**Excess Homozygosity (F_HOM):**
```
F_HOM = (O_HOM - E_HOM) / (N_SNP - E_HOM)

Where:
- O_HOM = observed homozygous SNPs
- E_HOM = expected homozygous SNPs under HWE = ∑(2pᵢqᵢ)
- N_SNP = total number of SNPs analyzed
```

**1.3.3 Inbreeding Validation and Comparison**

**Correlation Assessment:**
```
Expected correlation: r(F_ped, F_ROH) > 0.8 for accurate pedigree
Outlier detection: |F_ped - F_ROH| > 2×SD(F_ped - F_ROH)
```

**Bias Detection:**
```
Systematic bias: E[F_ped - F_ROH] ≠ 0
Proportional bias: slope ≠ 1 in regression F_ROH ~ F_ped
```

## Phase 2: Deregressed Proof Calculation - Garrick et al. (2009) Method

### Step 2.1: BLUP Analysis for EBV and PEV Extraction

**Objective:** Calculate EBVs with accurate prediction error variances

**2.1.1 Mixed Model Equations (MME) Setup**

**Standard Animal Model:**
```
[X'X    X'Z] [β] = [X'y]
[Z'X  Z'Z+A⁻¹α] [u]   [Z'y]

Where:
- α = σ²ₑ/σ²ₐ (variance ratio)
- A⁻¹ = inverse of additive relationship matrix
- β = vector of fixed effects
- u = vector of random animal effects (EBVs)
```

**2.1.2 Prediction Error Variance Extraction**

**PEV Calculation from MME:**
```
C = MME⁻¹ = [C₁₁  C₁₂]
            [C₂₁  C₂₂]

PEV(uᵢ) = C₂₂(i,i) × σ²ₑ

Where C₂₂(i,i) is the i-th diagonal element of C₂₂
```

**Reliability Calculation:**
```
rel(uᵢ) = 1 - PEV(uᵢ)/σ²ₐ

Quality Check: 0 < rel(uᵢ) < 1 for all animals
```

### Step 2.2: Mendelian Sampling Variance Calculation

**Objective:** Compute individual-specific Mendelian sampling variances following Garrick et al. (2009)

**2.2.1 Parent Average PEV Calculation**

**For Known Parents:**
```
PEV_PA(i) = 0.25 × [PEV(sire) + PEV(dam) + 2×Cov(sire,dam)]

Where:
Cov(sire,dam) = C₂₂(sire,dam) × σ²ₑ from MME inverse
```

**For Unknown Parents:**
```
PEV_PA(i) = 0.25 × σ²ₐ (one parent unknown)
PEV_PA(i) = 0.50 × σ²ₐ (both parents unknown)
```

**2.2.2 Mendelian Sampling PEV**

**Individual MS Variance:**
```
PEV_MS(i) = PEV(i) - PEV_PA(i)

Theoretical bounds: 0 ≤ PEV_MS(i) ≤ 0.5×σ²ₐ

MS Reliability: rel_MS(i) = 1 - PEV_MS(i)/σ²ₐ
```

**Quality Control Checks:**
```
1. PEV_MS(i) > 0 for all animals
2. rel_MS(i) > 0.1 for inclusion in GWAS
3. rel_MS(founder) ≈ 0.5 for base population
```

### Step 2.3: Deregressed Proof (DRP) Calculation

**2.3.1 Parent Average EBV**

**Parent Average Calculation:**
```
PA(i) = 0.5 × [EBV(sire) + EBV(dam)]

For unknown parents: PA(i) = 0
```

**2.3.2 DRP Formula (Garrick et al. 2009)**

**Deregressed EBV:**
```
DRP(i) = PA(i) + [EBV(i) - PA(i)] / rel_MS(i)

Simplified form when PA known:
DRP(i) = [EBV(i) × rel(i) - PA(i) × rel_PA] / rel_MS(i)

Where:
rel_PA = reliability of parent average
rel_MS(i) = Mendelian sampling reliability
```

**2.3.3 DRP Weights for GWAS**

**Weight Calculation:**
```
w(i) = rel_MS(i) / [1 - rel_MS(i)]

Alternative weight (for very high reliability):
w(i) = rel_MS(i) / k

Where k is a constant (e.g., 0.1) to prevent extreme weights
```

**2.3.4 DRP Quality Control**

**Validation Metrics:**
```
1. Var(DRP) > Var(EBV) [successful deregression]
2. Mean(DRP) ≈ 0 [unbiased]
3. |DRP(i)| < 4×SD(DRP) [outlier detection]
4. Correlation check: cor(DRP, EBV) ≈ √h² [theoretical expectation]
```

## Phase 3: Genome-Wide Association Study - Enhanced Protocol

### Step 3.1: Genomic Data Quality Control

**Objective:** Prepare high-quality SNP dataset for inbred population analysis

**3.1.1 Marker Quality Control Parameters**

**SNP Filtering Criteria (Adjusted for Inbred Population):**
```
Minor Allele Frequency: MAF > 0.005 (relaxed for inbred populations)
Call Rate: >90% across all samples
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium: P > 10⁻¹⁰ (very relaxed due to expected inbreeding)
Linkage Disequilibrium Pruning: r² < 0.95 (retain more markers due to high LD)
```

**3.1.2 Population Structure Assessment**

**Principal Component Analysis:**
```
Genomic Relationship Matrix: G = (XX')/∑2pᵢ(1-pᵢ)

Where:
- X = centered genotype matrix: Xᵢⱼ = (SNPᵢⱼ - 2pⱼ)
- pⱼ = allele frequency of SNP j

Eigendecomposition: G = QΛQ'
PC scores = first k eigenvectors explaining >80% variance
```

**Effective Population Size Estimation:**
```
From LD decay: Nₑ = 1/(4c × r²)

Where:
- c = recombination distance (Morgans)
- r² = linkage disequilibrium at distance c
```

### Step 3.2: GWAS Mixed Linear Model Implementation

**3.2.1 Enhanced MLM for Inbred Populations**

**Model Structure:**
```
DRP = Xβ + Zu + ε

Where:
- DRP = deregressed proof vector
- X = design matrix for fixed effects [intercept, PCs, family effects]
- β = fixed effects vector
- Z = incidence matrix for random effects
- u ~ N(0, Gσ²ᵤ) or u ~ N(0, Aσ²ᵤ)
- ε ~ N(0, Wσ²ₑ) with W = diag(weights)
```

**Fixed Effects Selection:**
```
Minimum fixed effects:
- Population structure: PC₁, PC₂, PC₃
- Major family effects (if single family dominates)
- Generation trends (if significant)

Model selection: Use AIC/BIC to determine optimal PC number
```

**3.2.2 Single-SNP Association Testing**

**Test Statistic for Each SNP:**
```
For SNP j: DRP = μ + SNPⱼβⱼ + PCs + u + ε

Wald Test: t = β̂ⱼ/SE(β̂ⱼ) ~ t(df)
F-statistic: F = t² ~ F(1,df)
P-value: P = 2×[1-Φ(|t|)] for large samples
```

**Effect Size Estimation:**
```
Allele substitution effect: αⱼ = β̂ⱼ
Proportion of genetic variance: R²ⱼ = 2pⱼqⱼα²ⱼ/σ²ₐ
Proportion of phenotypic variance: R²ₚⱼ = 2pⱼqⱼα²ⱼ/σ²ₚ
```

**3.2.3 Multiple Testing Correction**

**Significance Thresholds:**
```
Bonferroni correction: α_adj = α/m where m = number of tests
FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg):
- Order P-values: P₍₁₎ ≤ P₍₂₎ ≤ ... ≤ P₍ₘ₎
- Find largest k: P₍ₖ₎ ≤ (k/m)×α
- Reject all H₀ for i ≤ k

Suggestive threshold: 1/m (one false positive per genome scan)
Significant threshold: 0.05/m (genome-wide significance)
```

**Genomic Control:**
```
Inflation factor: λ = median(χ²obs)/median(χ²expected)
Adjusted test statistic: χ²adj = χ²obs/λ

Accept if: 0.95 < λ < 1.10 (well-controlled population structure)
```

### Step 3.3: Results Interpretation and Validation

**3.3.1 QTL Region Definition**

**Lead SNP Identification:**
```
Lead SNP = SNP with minimum P-value in each significant region
Significance boundary: P < genome-wide threshold

QTL interval boundaries:
- Physical: ±1 Mb around lead SNP
- Statistical: SNPs with -log₁₀(P) > [max -log₁₀(P) - 2]
- LD-based: r² > 0.5 with lead SNP
```

**3.3.2 Variance Explained Calculation**

**Total Variance Explained:**
```
For all significant SNPs:
R²total = ∑ⱼ[2pⱼqⱼα²ⱼ]/σ²ₐ

Adjustment for LD between SNPs:
R²adj = ∑ⱼα²ⱼVar(SNPⱼ)/σ²ₐ where Var(SNPⱼ) accounts for LD structure
```

**3.3.3 Independent Validation**

**Family-Based Test:**
```
Within-family association test:
For each family: DRPoffspring ~ SNPoffspring + parent_average_SNP

Significant if: P_family < 0.05 AND consistent effect direction
```

**Cross-Validation:**
```
Leave-one-chromosome-out validation:
1. Remove chromosome containing QTL
2. Re-run GWAS on remaining chromosomes
3. Test QTL effect in held-out chromosome
4. Significant validation if P < 0.05
```

---

## Phase 4: Mendelian Sampling Variance Analysis

### Step 4.1: Within-Family Variance Assessment

**Objective:** Quantify genetic variance available within families for continued selection

**4.1.1 Family-Based Variance Calculation**

**Direct Method (Using EBVs):**
```
For family j with nⱼ full-sibs:
σ²MS(j) = Var(EBVᵢ|family j)

Unbiased estimator: σ²MS(j) = ∑(EBVᵢⱼ - ĒBVⱼ)²/(nⱼ-1)

Population estimate: σ²MS = ∑wⱼσ²MS(j)/∑wⱼ
where wⱼ = nⱼ × average reliability in family j
```

**Theoretical Expectation:**
```
Expected MS variance: σ²MS,theory = 0.5 × σ²ₐ × (1 - F̄parents)

Where F̄parents = average inbreeding of parents in population

Comparison metric: Efficiency = σ²MS,observed / σ²MS,theory
```

**4.1.2 Finite Population Corrections**

**Selection Within Families:**
```
If best offspring selected from each family:
σ²MS,selected = σ²MS × [1 - i²(nⱼ-1)/nⱼ]

Where i = selection intensity for family size nⱼ
```

**Drift Effects:**
```
Expected drift variance per generation: σ²drift = σ²ₐ/(2Nₑ)
Observed MS variance: σ²MS,obs = σ²MS,theory - σ²drift,cumulative
```

### Step 4.2: Selection Response Prediction

**4.2.1 Response to Selection Formula**

**Single Generation Response:**
```
ΔG = h² × i × σₚ × (1/L)

Enhanced formula for finite population:
ΔG = √(σ²MS) × i × accuracy_of_selection

Where:
- σ²MS = observed Mendelian sampling variance
- i = selection intensity (function of proportion selected)
- accuracy = √reliability of selection criterion
```

**4.2.2 Selection Intensity Calculation**

**Truncation Selection:**
```
For proportion p selected:
i = φ(x)/p where Φ(x) = 1-p

Approximation for small p: i ≈ √(2ln(1/p))
```

**Family Selection (Current DU6 System):**
```
Between family selection: i_bf = i_truncation × √h²_family
Within family selection: i_wf = i_truncation × √h²_individual

Combined intensity: i_total = √(i²_bf + i²_wf)
```

**4.2.3 Selection Limit Prediction**

**Plateau Prediction:**
```
Selection limit = μ₀ + (σₐ × i)/√(2s)

Where:
- μ₀ = current population mean
- s = selection intensity coefficient
- Generations to plateau ≈ -ln(0.1) × Nₑ/(i²)
```

**Mutation-Selection Balance:**
```
Equilibrium variance: σ²ₑq = 2Nₑμσ²ₐ/(2Nₑs + 1)

Where:
- μ = mutation rate per generation
- s = selection coefficient
```

---

## Phase 5: Bottleneck Analysis and Population Genomics

### Step 5.1: Demographic History Reconstruction

**Objective:** Quantify genetic diversity changes during facility transfer

**5.1.1 Allele Frequency Spectrum Analysis**

**Pre/Post Bottleneck Comparison:**
```
For each SNP j:
Δpⱼ = |pⱼ,post - pⱼ,pre|

Summary statistics:
- Mean frequency change: Δp̄ = ∑Δpⱼ/m
- Variance in frequency change: Var(Δp) = ∑(Δpⱼ - Δp̄)²/(m-1)
- Proportion with large changes: P(Δpⱼ > 0.2)
```

**Expected vs. Observed Changes:**
```
Expected change under pure drift: E[Δp²] = pq/2Nₑ

Test statistic: χ² = ∑[(Δpⱼ)² - E[Δp²ⱼ]]²/Var[Δp²ⱼ]

Significant deviation indicates selection during bottleneck
```

**5.1.2 Effective Population Size Estimation**

**Linkage Disequilibrium Method:**
```
r² = D²/(pₐpᵦqₐqᵦ) where D = pₐᵦ - pₐpᵦ

Expected LD decay: E[r²] = 1/(1 + 4Nₑc) + 1/n

Nₑ estimation: N̂ₑ = (1/4c) × [(1/r² - 1/n) - 1]

Where:
- c = recombination distance (Morgans)
- n = sample size correction
```

**Temporal Method (if multiple generations available):**
```
F_st = (p₁ - p₂)²/[p̄(1-p̄)]

Nₑ = t/[2(F_st - 1/(2n₁) - 1/(2n₂))]

Where:
- t = number of generations between samples
- n₁, n₂ = sample sizes
```

**5.1.3 Founder Contribution Analysis**

**Genomic Segment Tracking:**
```
For each chromosome segment:
1. Identify founder origin using phased haplotypes
2. Calculate proportional contribution: cᵢ = Lᵢ/Ltotal
3. Track changes across generations

Founder genome equivalents: fge = 1/∑cᵢ²
```

### Step 5.2: Selection vs. Drift Partitioning

**5.2.1 Neutral Evolution Test**

**Wright-Fisher Model Expectation:**
```
Expected allele frequency: p(t) = p₀ + random walk

Variance in frequency change: Var[p(t) - p₀] = p₀q₀[1 - (1-1/2Nₑ)ᵗ]
```

**Selection Coefficient Estimation:**
```
For SNP under selection:
Δp = sp(1-p)/w̄ + drift component

Selection coefficient: ŝ = [Δp_observed - Δp_drift]/[p(1-p)]
```

**5.2.2 Genomic Scan for Selection**

**Standardized Frequency Change:**
```
For each SNP: Z = Δp/√[p₀q₀/(2Nₑ)]

|Z| > 2.58 indicates significant selection (P < 0.01)
```

**Sliding Window Analysis:**
```
Window size: 1 Mb
Calculate mean |Z| per window
Identify regions with consistently high |Z| values
```

---

## Phase 6: Fertility-Inbreeding Analysis

### Step 6.1: Multi-trait Inbreeding Depression Modeling

**Objective:** Quantify relationship between inbreeding and fertility decline

**6.1.1 Inbreeding Depression Model**

**Linear Model:**
```
Fertilityᵢⱼ = μ + βF×Fᵢ + Generation + Dam_age + Parityⱼ + aᵢ + eᵢⱼ

Where:
- βF = inbreeding depression coefficient
- Fᵢ = inbreeding coefficient of animal i
- aᵢ ~ N(0, Aσ²ₐ) = additive genetic effect
```

**Non-linear Model (Threshold Effects):**
```
Fertilityᵢⱼ = μ + β₁F×Fᵢ + β₂F×F²ᵢ + other effects

Or segmented regression:
Fertilityᵢⱼ = μ + β₁F×min(Fᵢ, τ) + β₂F×max(0, Fᵢ-τ) + other effects

Where τ = threshold inbreeding level
```

**6.1.2 Recent vs. Ancient Inbreeding**

**ROH Length-Based Classification:**
```
Recent inbreeding: F_ROH(>5Mb) / F_ROH(total)
Ancient inbreeding: F_ROH(1-5Mb) / F_ROH(total)

Model: Fertility = μ + β_recent×F_recent + β_ancient×F_ancient + other effects
```

**6.1.3 Inbreeding Load Estimation**

**Number of Lethal Equivalents:**
```
ln(W) = -B×F

Where:
- W = fitness measure (fertility index)
- B = number of lethal equivalents
- F = inbreeding coefficient

Estimation: B̂ = -slope of regression ln(Fertility) ~ F
```

### Step 6.2: Critical Threshold Identification

**6.2.1 Segmented Regression Analysis**

**Change Point Detection:**
```
Model: y = β₀ + β₁×x + β₂×max(0, x-τ) + ε

Likelihood function:
L(τ) = -n/2×ln(2π) - n/2×ln(σ²) - RSS(τ)/(2σ²)

Optimal change point: τ̂ = argmax L(τ)
```

**6.2.2 Population Viability Analysis**

**Fertility Threshold for Population Persistence:**
```
Replacement rate: R₀ = Σlₓmₓ ≥ 1.0

Where:
- lₓ = survival probability to age x
- mₓ = fertility rate at age x

Critical inbreeding: F_critical where R₀ = 1.0
```

**Time to Extinction Probability:**
```
Stochastic model:
P(extinction by time t) = Φ((μ_N(t) - ln(N₀))/σ_N√t)

Where:
- μ_N(t) = expected log population size at time t
- σ_N = environmental stochasticity variance
- N₀ = current population size
```

---

## Phase 7: Breeding Strategy Optimization

### Step 7.1: Multi-objective Selection Framework

**Objective:** Balance genetic gain with population sustainability

**7.1.1 Selection Index Construction**

**Economic Selection Index:**
```
I = Σwᵢhᵢrᵢᵍσᵢ

Where:
- wᵢ = economic weight for trait i
- hᵢ = square root of heritability for trait i  
- rᵢᵍ = genetic correlation between trait i and index
- σᵢ = genetic standard deviation for trait i
```

**Multi-trait Index for DU6:**
```
I = w_BM42×EBV_BM42 + w_fert×EBV_fertility - w_inb×F_penalty

Economic weights (relative):
- w_BM42 = 1.0 (reference)
- w_fert = 0.3 (30% of BM42 importance)
- w_inb = 0.5 (inbreeding penalty)
```

**7.1.2 Genetic Correlation Estimation**

**Bivariate Animal Model:**
```
[y₁] = [X₁  0 ] [β₁] + [Z₁  0 ] [u₁] + [e₁]
[y₂]   [0   X₂] [β₂]   [0   Z₂] [u₂]   [e₂]

Genetic covariance matrix:
G = [σ²ₐ₁      σₐ₁ₐ₂  ]
    [σₐ₁ₐ₂     σ²ₐ₂   ]

Genetic correlation: rG = σₐ₁ₐ₂/(σₐ₁×σₐ₂)
```

### Step 7.2: Optimal Contribution Selection (OCS)

**7.2.1 Genomic OCS Formulation**

**Optimization Problem:**
```
Maximize: c'μ (genetic merit)
Subject to: c'Gc ≤ ΔF_max (inbreeding constraint)
           Σc = 1 (contribution sum constraint)
           c ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)

Where:
- c = vector of parent contributions
- μ = vector of parent breeding values
- G = genomic relationship matrix
- ΔF_max = maximum allowed inbreeding increase
```

**7.2.2 Lagrangian Solution**

**First-order Conditions:**
```
∂L/∂c = μ - λ₁×2Gc - λ₂×1 - λ₃ = 0
∂L/∂λ₁ = ΔF_max - c'Gc = 0
∂L/∂λ₂ = 1 - 1'c = 0

Solution: c* = (G⁻¹/2)(μ - λ₂×1)/λ₁
```

**7.2.3 Constraint Selection**

**Inbreeding Rate Constraint:**
```
Conservative: ΔF ≤ 0.005 per generation (0.5%)
Moderate: ΔF ≤ 0.01 per generation (1.0%)  
Liberal: ΔF ≤ 0.02 per generation (2.0%)

Expected inbreeding increase: ΔF = 0.5 × c'Gc
```

**Population Size Constraint:**
```
Minimum effective size: Nₑ ≥ 1/(2×ΔF)
Variance effective size: Nₑ,v = 1/∑cᵢ²
```

### Step 7.3: Scenario Analysis and Risk Assessment

**7.3.1 Breeding Scenario Simulation**

**Simulation Framework:**
```
For each generation t:
1. Select parents using OCS with constraints
2. Generate offspring based on Mendelian sampling
3. Update allele frequencies: p(t+1) = ∑cᵢ×pᵢ(t)
4. Calculate inbreeding: F(t+1) = F(t) + ΔF(t)
5. Predict fertility: Fertility(t+1) = f(F(t+1))
6. Update population size: N(t+1) = N(t) × Fertility(t+1)
```

**Parameter Updates:**
```
Genetic variance: σ²ₐ(t+1) = σ²ₐ(t) × [1 - 2×ΔF(t)]
Selection intensity: i(t+1) = f(N(t+1), selection_proportion)
Expected response: ΔG(t+1) = i(t+1) × σₐ(t+1) × accuracy
```

**7.3.2 Risk Metrics Calculation**

**Population Extinction Risk:**
```
Extinction threshold: N < N_min (e.g., 20 breeding animals)

Probability calculation:
P(extinction by time T) = ∫₀ᵀ λ(t)×S(t)dt

Where:
- λ(t) = instantaneous extinction rate at time t
- S(t) = survival probability to time t
```

**Genetic Diversity Loss:**
```
Heterozygosity over time: H(t) = H₀ × (1 - ΔF)ᵗ

Critical diversity level: H_critical = 0.5 × H₀
Time to critical level: t_critical = ln(0.5)/ln(1 - ΔF)
```

**Selection Response Decline:**
```
Response reduction: ΔG(t)/ΔG(0) = √[σ²ₐ(t)/σ²ₐ(0)]

Response half-life: t₀.₅ = ln(0.5)/ln(1 - 2×ΔF)
```

**7.3.3 Optimal Strategy Identification**

**Multi-criteria Decision Analysis:**
```
Utility function: U = w₁×ΔG + w₂×(1-P_extinction) + w₃×H_retained

Pareto frontier: Identify non-dominated solutions
Maximize U subject to: P_extinction < 0.05, H_retained > 0.5
```

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
```
Vary key parameters:
- Economic weights (w_BM42, w_fertility)
- Inbreeding constraints (ΔF_max)
- Selection intensity
- Population size

Robust strategy: Performs well across parameter ranges
```

## Integration and Validation Protocol

### Analytical Workflow Validation

**Cross-Method Consistency Checks:**

**1. Variance Component Validation:**
```
Consistency test: h²_pedigree ≈ h²_genomic (within 95% CI)
Bias detection: |h²_method1 - h²_method2| < 0.1
Monte Carlo validation: Simulate data with known h², test recovery
```

**2. Inbreeding Measure Correlation:**
```
Expected relationships:
- r(F_ped, F_ROH) > 0.8 for accurate pedigree
- F_ROH > F_ped in recent generations (captures recent inbreeding better)
- F_HOM intermediate between F_ped and F_ROH
```

**3. GWAS-Quantitative Genetics Consistency:**
```
Validation: ∑R²_SNP ≤ h²_total
Expected: ∑R²_SNP ≈ 0.3-0.7 × h²_total (depending on LD coverage)
Red flag: ∑R²_SNP > h²_total (indicates inflation)
```

### Statistical Power Analysis

**Sample Size Requirements:**

**1. Variance Component Estimation:**
```
Required families: N_fam ≥ 50 for h² estimation (SE < 0.1)
Required offspring per family: n_off ≥ 5 for family variance estimation
Total sample size: N_total ≥ 500 for stable REML convergence
```

**2. GWAS Power Calculation:**
```
Power = Φ(√(N×MAF×(1-MAF)×α²/σ²_error) - Φ⁻¹(1-α/2))

Where:
- N = effective sample size (accounting for structure)
- α² = SNP effect size
- σ²_error = error variance (includes polygenic + residual)

Minimum detectable QTL: α²_min = 2×σ²_error×Φ⁻¹(1-α/2)²/[N×MAF×(1-MAF)]
```

**3. Selection Response Prediction:**
```
Prediction accuracy: r = √(h²×n_qtl×average_MAF)
Minimum accuracy for practical use: r > 0.3
Required marker density: 1 SNP per 0.1 cM for r > 0.5
```

### Quality Assurance Protocol

**Data Quality Gates:**

**1. Phenotype Quality:**
```
Gate 1: Missing data < 10% for critical variables
Gate 2: Outliers < 1% of total observations
Gate 3: Temporal trends explained by known factors
Gate 4: Heritability within expected range (0.1-0.8)
```

**2. Genomic Data Quality:**
```
Gate 1: Call rate > 90% for samples and SNPs
Gate 2: MAF > 0.005 for included SNPs  
Gate 3: HWE P-value > 10⁻¹⁰ (adjusted for inbreeding)
Gate 4: Sample heterozygosity consistent with expected F
```

**3. Analysis Quality:**
```
Gate 1: Model convergence achieved (gradient < 10⁻³)
Gate 2: Variance components positive and bounded
Gate 3: GWAS inflation factor 0.95 < λ < 1.10
Gate 4: Cross-validation accuracy > 0.3
```

### Interpretation Framework

**Effect Size Classification:**

**1. Variance Components:**
```
Small effect: σ²_component < 0.05 × σ²_phenotypic
Medium effect: 0.05 ≤ σ²_component < 0.20 × σ²_phenotypic  
Large effect: σ²_component ≥ 0.20 × σ²_phenotypic
```

**2. QTL Effects:**
```
Small QTL: R² < 1% of genetic variance
Medium QTL: 1% ≤ R² < 5% of genetic variance
Large QTL: R² ≥ 5% of genetic variance

Effect size in phenotypic units: d = α/σ_phenotypic
```

**3. Inbreeding Depression:**
```
Mild depression: 1-10% fitness reduction per 10% increase in F
Moderate depression: 10-25% fitness reduction per 10% increase in F
Severe depression: >25% fitness reduction per 10% increase in F
```

**Biological Significance Thresholds:**

**1. Selection Response:**
```
Meaningful response: ΔG > 0.1 × σ_phenotypic per generation
Economically significant: ΔG > economic threshold
Biologically relevant: ΔG detectable above measurement error
```

**2. Population Sustainability:**
```
Sustainable: P(extinction in 50 generations) < 0.05
At risk: 0.05 ≤ P(extinction) < 0.20
Critical: P(extinction) ≥ 0.20
```
