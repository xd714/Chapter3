Great question! Let me explain how to apply this method when you have actual data and pedigree. The method uses your real data and pedigree to set up the problem, but then uses simulated data during the estimation process.

## Step-by-Step Implementation with Real Data

### Phase 1: Setup Using Your Real Data and Pedigree

1. **Read your data and pedigree files**
   - Animal IDs, phenotypes, fixed effects
   - Pedigree relationships (sire, dam for each animal)

2. **Build the relationship matrix structure**
   - Compute diagonal elements of A⁻¹ (inverse relationship matrix)
   - Generate Cholesky factor L where LL' = A
   - This uses your actual pedigree structure

3. **Set up design matrices**
   - X matrix (connects animals to fixed effects)
   - Z matrix (connects records to animals)
   - These come from your actual data structure

### Phase 2: Initial Analysis with Real Data

4. **Get starting values**
   - Solve mixed model equations with your real data once
   - This gives initial estimates of variance components
   - Use these as starting values (σ²ₐ⁽⁰⁾, σ²ₑ⁽⁰⁾)

### Phase 3: Iterative Estimation Using Simulation

Now the Monte Carlo resampling begins:

5. **Generate B random datasets** (this is the key step)
   ```
   For i = 1 to B:
     yᵢ = Xb⁽ᵗ⁾ + Zhᵢ + gᵢ
   ```
   Where:
   - **Xb⁽ᵗ⁾**: Fixed effects (can set b=0 as mentioned in paper)
   - **Zhᵢ**: Random genetic effects where hᵢ = L×random_normal(0,1)×√σ²ₐ⁽ᵗ⁾
   - **gᵢ**: Random residuals where gᵢ = random_normal(0,1)×√σ²ₑ⁽ᵗ⁾
   - **L**: Cholesky factor from YOUR pedigree
   - **Z**: Design matrix from YOUR data structure

6. **Solve mixed model equations for each simulated dataset**
   ```
   For each yᵢ, solve: yᵢ = Xb + Zû + e
   ```
   This gives predicted breeding values ûᵢ for each simulation

7. **Estimate prediction error variance**
   ```
   VarMC(û) = (U'U - U'11'U/B)/(B-1)
   ```
   Where U contains all the ûᵢ solutions

8. **Update variance components**
   ```
   σ²ₐ⁽ᵗ⁺¹⁾ = σ²ₐ⁽ᵗ⁾ + (û'A⁻¹û - tr(A⁻¹VarMC(û)))/n
   σ²ₑ⁽ᵗ⁺¹⁾ = usual REML formula
   ```

9. **Repeat steps 5-8 until convergence**

## Practical Example

Let's say you have:
- 1000 animals with growth rate data
- Pedigree going back 5 generations
- Fixed effects: sex, year, management group

**Your real data looks like:**
```
Animal_ID  Sire  Dam  Sex  Year  Group  Growth_Rate
1001       501   502   M   2020    1      245
1002       501   503   F   2020    1      189
...
```

**The algorithm:**
1. Uses your pedigree to build A⁻¹ and L
2. Uses your data structure for X and Z matrices
3. Gets initial variance estimates from your real data
4. Then generates 10-50 "fake" datasets with same structure but simulated phenotypes
5. Analyzes these fake datasets to estimate prediction error variance
6. Updates variance components and repeats

## Why Simulate When You Have Real Data?

The key insight is that you need your real data structure (pedigree relationships, design matrices) but you simulate phenotypes because:

1. **Unbiased estimation**: Simulated data has no selection bias
2. **Faster convergence**: No genetic trends to account for
3. **Avoids matrix inversion**: The simulation approach estimates what you need without inverting large matrices

## Implementation Tips

- Start with B=10-20 simulations per iteration
- Use your actual pedigree structure throughout
- The final variance component estimates apply to your real data
- Computational time scales linearly with number of animals, not exponentially

The beauty is that you get REML-quality estimates for your real data without the computational burden of matrix inversion!
