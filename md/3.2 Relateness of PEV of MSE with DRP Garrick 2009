Great question. This touches the core of what deregressed breeding values (DRP) actually represent and why Garrick et al. (2009) involved the prediction error variance (PEV) of the Mendelian sampling effect in their formula.

Let’s unpack this carefully.

⸻

1. What is the goal of deregression?

Deregressed breeding values (DRP) are designed to strip off the contribution of the parental average (PA) from an individual’s estimated breeding value (EBV), leaving a value that represents the individual’s own genetic information (i.e., the Mendelian sampling term), untainted by the information that came via ancestors.

This is crucial because if you don’t remove the PA properly, and you use these values in a second genetic evaluation (like genomic prediction), you risk double-counting ancestral information.

2. Why PEV of the Mendelian sampling effect matters?

The Mendelian sampling term (MS) is the deviation of an animal’s breeding value from its PA:

MS = EBV - PA

However, this MS is estimated with error in the genetic evaluation model — it is not a perfect measure because data is limited.

The prediction error variance (PEV) associated with the MS effect quantifies how uncertain this estimation is. In Garrick’s formula, this error variance is essential for determining how much weight the deregressed value should have in subsequent analyses.

3. How does Garrick et al. (2009) incorporate this?

Garrick’s formula for deregressing includes the term:

DRP = \frac{EBV}{r}

where r^2 = 1 - \frac{PEV}{\sigma^2_a}, with \sigma^2_a being the additive genetic variance.

But for deregressing, the actual key part is the reliability (r²) of the MS term itself — this is derived from the PEV of the MS effect.

Garrick’s method carefully adjusts the weight given to an individual’s DRP by accounting for this reliability:

w_i = \frac{1 - r^2_{PA,i}}{r^2_{i} - r^2_{PA,i}}

where:
	•	r^2_i: reliability of the animal’s EBV,
	•	r^2_{PA,i}: reliability of the PA.

But r² itself is directly linked to PEV, because:

r^2 = 1 - \frac{PEV}{\sigma^2_a}

So, the PEV of MS (or the individual EBV minus the PA) directly informs how much actual information comes from the individual, vs. how much was simply inherited from the pedigree.

If PEV is large, the MS estimate is unreliable — meaning you can’t fully trust the animal’s own genetic signal, and the deregressed EBV must reflect that uncertainty.

4. In plain words:

Garrick’s deregression method carefully uses the PEV of the Mendelian sampling effect to estimate how “pure” the animal’s own genetic information is. Without this, deregressed breeding values could mistakenly contain too much ancestral influence, distorting downstream analyses (like genomic predictions).

In other words:
👉 PEV of MS tells you how noisy the animal’s own genetic contribution estimate is.
👉 Deregression needs this to correctly scale and weight the animal’s EBV, avoiding double counting parental info.
