# Research Methodology Verification and Literature Support

## Phase 1: Quantitative Genetic Analysis

### Step 1.1: Genetic Variance Estimation

**Will it work?**
Yes. The use of REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) and GBLUP (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) for variance estimation is standard in quantitative genetics.

**Literature Support:**

- **REML for variance estimation:**
    - Henderson, C.R. (1984). Applications of Linear Models in Animal Breeding.
    - Meyer, K. (2007). "WOMBAT—a tool for mixed model analyses in quantitative genetics by REML." Journal of Zhejiang University Science B.
- **GBLUP and genomic partitioning:**
    - VanRaden, P.M. (2008). "Efficient methods to compute genomic predictions." J Dairy Sci.
    - Yang, J. et al. (2010). "Common SNPs explain a large proportion of the heritability for human height." Nature Genetics.


### Step 1.2: Inbreeding Assessment

**Will it work?**
Yes. Both pedigree-based and genomic inbreeding coefficients (F_ped, F_ROH, F_HOM) are widely used and robust.

**Literature Support:**

- **Pedigree vs. genomic inbreeding:**
    - Keller, M.C. et al. (2011). "Runs of homozygosity in European populations." European Journal of Human Genetics.
    - Purfield, D.C. et al. (2012). "Runs of homozygosity and population history in cattle." BMC Genetics.

## Phase 2: Bottleneck Impact Assessment

### Step 2.1: Pre/Post Transfer Analysis

**Will it work?**
Yes. Allele frequency spectrum analysis, founder genome equivalents, and LD decay are standard for bottleneck assessment.

**Literature Support:**

- **Bottleneck and allele frequency:**
    - Luikart, G. et al. (1998). "Distortion of allele frequency distributions provides a test for recent population bottlenecks." Journal of Heredity.
- **Founder genome equivalents:**
    - Lacy, R.C. (1989). "Analysis of founder representation in pedigrees: founder equivalents and founder genome equivalents." Zoo Biology.
- **LD analysis:**
    - Hill, W.G., \& Robertson, A. (1968). "Linkage disequilibrium in finite populations." Theoretical and Applied Genetics.


### Step 2.2: Selection Response Modeling

**Will it work?**
Yes. Calculating genetic gain and separating genetic from environmental trends via mixed models is standard.

**Literature Support:**

- **Selection response and mixed models:**
    - Falconer, D.S., \& Mackay, T.F.C. (1996). Introduction to Quantitative Genetics.
    - Hill, W.G. (2010). "Understanding and using quantitative genetic variation." Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.

## Phase 3: Genomic Analysis - Two-Step GWAS Approach

### Step 3.1: De-regressed EBV Calculation

**Will it work?**
Yes. Deregressed EBVs are the gold standard for GWAS in structured populations.

**Literature Support:**

- Garrick, D.J. et al. (2009). "Deregressing estimated breeding values and weighting information for genomic regression analyses." Genetics Selection Evolution.


### Step 3.2: Genome-Wide Association Study

**Will it work?**
Yes. The described QC, population structure correction, and mixed linear model GWAS are best practices.

**Literature Support:**

- **GWAS in structured populations:**
    - Yu, J. et al. (2006). "A unified mixed-model method for association mapping." Nature Genetics.
    - Yang, J. et al. (2014). "Advantages and pitfalls in the application of mixed-model association methods." Nature Genetics.

## Phase 4: Mendelian Sampling Variance Analysis

### Step 4.1: Within-Family Variance Assessment

**Will it work?**
Yes. Both pedigree and genomic approaches to Mendelian sampling variance are valid.

**Literature Support:**

- **Mendelian sampling variance:**
    - VanRaden, P.M. (2008). "Efficient methods to compute genomic predictions." J Dairy Sci.
    - Hill, W.G., \& Weir, B.S. (2011). "Variation in actual relationship as a consequence of Mendelian sampling and linkage." Genetics Research.


### Step 4.2: Mutation Load Analysis

**Will it work?**
Yes, provided you have high-quality sequence data. Standard pipelines like GATK and VEP are widely used.

**Literature Support:**

- **Mutation load and detection:**
    - Keightley, P.D., \& Eyre-Walker, A. (2010). "What can we learn about the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations from DNA sequence data?" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.
    - DePristo, M.A. et al. (2011). "A framework for variation discovery and genotyping using next-generation DNA sequencing data." Nature Genetics.

## Phase 5: Fertility-Inbreeding Correlation Analysis

### Step 5.1: Reproductive Performance Modeling

**Will it work?**
Yes. Mixed models are the standard for analyzing inbreeding depression in fertility traits.

**Literature Support:**

- **Inbreeding depression in fertility:**
    - Kristensen, T.N., \& Sørensen, A.C. (2005). "Inbreeding–lessons from animal breeding, evolutionary biology and conservation genetics." Animal Science.
    - Leroy, G. (2014). "Inbreeding depression in livestock species: review and meta-analysis." Animal Genetics.
